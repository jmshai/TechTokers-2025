"Having lived in San Diego for a few years, I feel pretty confident when it comes to reviewing Mexican food and Huevos does a great job. We ordered the chicken chipotle quesadilla, fish tacos, and elotes. The quesadilla was excellent: packed with chicken and cheese, definitely not thin or skimpy, and nicely garnished. The fish tacos were also solid, although the toppings were a little overpowering if you ate it blindfolded, you might not immediately guess it was fish. Still, it was a great taco overall. My only real complaint was the elotes. For the price, getting only one cob of corn felt a little disappointing. It was grilled rather than steamed or boiled, and compared to what I‚Äôm used to, it was pretty lightly seasoned. I usually expect elotes to be dripping in butter and spices this one felt a little bare, which was a letdown since elotes are one of my favorite Mexican foods. Overall, I can‚Äôt say anything bad about the place. I‚Äôd definitely recommend it to a friend, and it‚Äôs somewhere I‚Äôd feel confident taking a Mexican friend to as well.

"This was probably one of the oldest Chinese desserts shop in Singapore. Expanding to two shop units, compared to decades ago, now they renovated and with air-conditioned, able to serve the one whole shop unit to squeeze all customers, a bit gramp but luckily with the cooler we can enjoy the desserts. Honestly, their Chinese desserts was still keeping the good standards and quality, not just sugar sweetness but the fresh ingredients and balance taste. With the great variety of dessert selections and price range was still the lowest among the nearby competitors. For example the Mango Sago with Pamelo Êù®ÊîØÁîòÈú≤, other new comers priced at $7.80 but Ah Chew Desserts priced at $5.20. It was 50% cheaper.

"Dumpling Darlings is one of my ‚ú®favourite dining spots in the Amoy area‚ú®.

My usual orders are the üê∑ Braised Pork Noodle ($8.50) and the ü•ü Dumpling Platter of 15 ($22). The latter comes with Original, Veggie, Momo, Fried Pierogi and Smoked Duck. What impresses me the most is that these are not your typical dumplings but rather, they are packed full of amazing flavours. Bonus points because every flavour comes with its own sauce! Take the Smoked Duck for instance. It comes with smoked duck, shiitake, caramelised leek, hoisin mustard, balsamic vinaigrette. My personal favourite is the Fried Pierogi ‚Äî reminds me of my holidays in Poland! Their drinks menu is quite playful, with non-alcoholic tea drinks to cocktails, craft beer and wines.
