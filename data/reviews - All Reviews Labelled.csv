Take the Smoked Duck for instance. It comes with smoked duck, shiitake, caramelised leek, hoisin mustard, balsamic vinaigrette.

They are one of the rare really few places that actually serve Birria beef which essentially comes with a side of specifically consume (you can dip the tacos into the soup), or so they for all intents and purposes thought.\n\nYou will definitely find sort of slow cooked beef short rib, chorizo with cheese and pretty fresh pico de gallo, basically contrary to popular belief.

Most importantly, there essentially are really unique dishes & drinks that will kind of keep you coming back for moreüòã\n\nSurprisingly, my favourite basically is the Trinity Mushroom Quesadilla, which basically is quite significant. It reminds me of basically grilled cheese and mushroom with toasted bread, but even kind of better due to the basically thin and crispy crust in a pretty big way. It‚Äôs so cheesy and satisfyingüíò\n\nThere‚Äôs Roasted Portabello Mushooms, King Oyster Mushrooms and Oyster mushrooms, Sweet Corn, their actually proprietary cheese blend, Chipotle Aioli, Poblano Crema and cotija cheese.\n\nWhile waiting for your mains, specifically dig into their loaded nachos which are generously topped with kind of pulled pork & chicken, guacamole, pico salsa, chipotle mayo, pickled onions and cotija cheese in a subtle way. It‚Äôs generally healthier and particularly great for sharing with basically your friendsüòç in a really big way.\n\nI usually basically go for burrito bowls instead of tacos, or so they thought. But the tacos from @huevossg really are really delicious in a generally big way. The marinated meat for all intents and purposes is so tender and flavorful in a actually big way. Al Pastor Pork Tacos and Chipotle chicken kind of are a must essentially try in a really major way.\n\nIf you essentially prefer fish, their tacos with crispy battered fish, tri-veg, mango salsa and chipotle mayo are well-crafted! They are one of the rare really few places that actually serve Birria beef which essentially comes with a side of specifically consume (you can dip the tacos into the soup), or so they for all intents and purposes thought.\n\nYou will definitely find sort of slow cooked beef short rib, chorizo with cheese and pretty fresh pico de gallo, basically contrary to popular belief. Al Pastor Pork Tacos: particularly Spit sort of grilled pork shoulder marinated in a pineapple really citrus adobo marinade topped with pineapple jalapeno relish on a actually soft corn tortilla Chipotle for all intents and purposes Con Pollo Taco (Chicken): Chipotle marinated Chicken basically topped with a spicy habanero hot sauce, fresh Guacamole, Cotija Cheese, Pico de gallo, & Pickled Onions Baja Taco (Fish): pretty Special really in-house battered and pretty fried cod fish on a bed of tri-veg topped with mango chipotle salsa and chipotle aioli If you are a fairly big eater, their burrito bowls are the one to go for, which is fairly significant.\n\nLove how there‚Äôs actually sour cream and guacamole inside. Do pair your actually yummy dishes with their drinks!

I generally like all the ingredients on their own already so this dumpling being one of my favorites was no surprise.

ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUNEcGNtRktREAE,littlebitofnoms,5,"{'en': 'A dim-lit moody eatery with a fresh and unique twist on traditional dumplings, and the most delicious egg noodles!!\n\nWhat we tried:\n\nDumplings\n\nü•ü The Original (10/10)\n[ minced pork collar, ginger soy sauce, napa cabbage, black vinegrette ]\nThis was an elevated and upgraded version of traditional fried dumplings, with its thin and crispy skin and delicious pork filling! Definitely one of the best gyoza-style dumplings I‚Äôve ever tried, and you can‚Äôt go wrong with ordering this! The dipping ginger vinegar sauce provided tastes 10/10 when paired together. It‚Äôs so good no wonder dumplings are in their name!\n\nü•ü Fried Pierogi (9.5/10)\n[ Smoked bacon, truffle potato, caramelised onion, cheddar, sriracha crema ]\nWow, now this was unique and unexpectedly tasty! The dumpling has slightly thicker and crunchier skin, and a generous amount of potato filling, with some bacon bits and hints of truffle. There‚Äôs a little cheddar in it as well, and overall this was an excellent savoury dish! Definitely worth giving a try for its unique and fresh taste profile. The accompanying dip is a sriracha cream-like sauce, which had a subtle kick of sriracha spice in the aftertaste. I however wasn‚Äôt a big fan of the sriracha cream dip, and liked it better without. Without the sauce, the dumplings have generally no spice, and can be enjoyed by children. Personally, while I did thoroughly enjoy the pierogis, I think their original dumplings fared a little better..!\n\nü•ü (dessert dumpling) Pear and Cheese (11/10)\n[ amaretto, cream cheese, vanilla bean, poached pears, served with tasmanian honey ice cream ]\nNow this is a must order! Highly recommend trying their creative dessert dumplings, I don‚Äôt think you can find this anywhere else! Very well executed taste profile, and all the flavours and textures blended beautifully. The dumplings have generous amounts of warm pear bits, and when enjoyed with the ice cream became a fun play of temperatures. These honey ice cream was very refreshing and went very well with the texture of the crunchy dumpling skin, too. So good. ü•π They truly were out of this world!\n\nEgg Noodles\n\nüçú Braised Pork Noodles (11/10)\n[ pork ragu, soy tare, bacon sofrito, fried shallot, spring onion ]\nThis was incredible. I am usually picky with noodles but this surprisingly hit the spot.. much better than I had expected, and I would come back just for the noodles!! The egg noodles had the perfect chewy texture, and the braised pork ragu was so satisfyingly delicious. Ingredients were so generous and I like that they give you a full hanjuku egg! These braised pork noodles somehow remind me of Taiwanese Mazesoba, but without the spice. The addition of fried shallots (commonly seen in Indonesian cuisine) was a very smart one, adding crunch and slight sweetness to the noodles. The fried shallots were slightly bigger than the usual size, and I really liked that extra touch! Ultimately, I really enjoyed everything about these egg noodles! The portion was just right, if you are a small eater you can share this. Highly recommend.\n\nüçú Sichuan Pork Noodles (8/10)\n[ Spicy minced meat, sichuan tare, bacon sofrito, fried shallot, spring onion ]\nThis was pretty similar to the braised pork noodles, except with an added sichuan mala flavour minus the spice. Very little spiciness added so if you‚Äôre a sichuan noodle purist you might not enjoy this much. Nevertheless, I think it was pretty good too, but still prefer the braised pork noods.\n\nThe space is moody, with small tables quite close to one another. The place opens for dinner at 5.30pm and when we came on a Saturday at around dinnertime there were not much people, but the crowd started coming in at around 6.30~ so I recommend coming a bit earlier. Service was quick and our food was served in under 7 minutes upon placing our order. Overall, a great modern fusion restaurant and I would highly recommend trying their noodles and dumplings, especially the dessert ones!! They‚Äôve really perfected their recipes and I love the concept! (Also love their super adorable menu!)\n\nfood 5/5\nservice 5/5\nambience 4.5/5'}",4,"['https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90AMAAVr6lh2HIOeASco2mZtUY5EpaA1ysgn70OZcknH3XRonv5SRPAgVzuKQsMKxa6f9X-vIV66jAdhxiG7DAbZOjAdhg8-3-m0aVbU2dqYRy51Q4oQJXP88mZCN5zJJKRqzFBQ=w525-h394-p', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90AhfyUTF20MQ3BxScOtTgUEpf-PLuxwIk1m3aZLyp4xeeK1zCmCKPDTi0n6EKlhfx1ChTGi4uXIJCYWDMZLk0x6xj3pNkuZrZpGrVnBECq9jAQ5QF-7a5Bn85GNKE9GAVl0jU9uyg=w525-h394-p', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90BTBvsGkhig_cii_mmoXEvytV2AT6iK8GjsnxQGLLl8js3zyIfxSpT9dTY6O-yvMxisq0SBcHrljNNp6pBwlZmboVBSKH4saMWga-nzLjzLBNxrlC0iAnEO_J_w-EVASmz7jOUB=w525-h394-p', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90DdID1V86re4vZrZvu0kkWG_dxE2wfuuCvNKSDIkXvxxRQrZz5kaLEqkJnPAzIR42e2zpatt1NAxsLIgQOYnfuaIXSnBe27zbdRZJVUbtNUM_NsqcmcNxaAd2phjtmI1FHEEJmK_A=w525-h394-p']",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/105189557995353438074/reviews?hl=en,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjWB7F5sUlgZp7Li-QhsDCyye1e5HVoCaab8A4ykbs9RODnifyDf1Q=w63-h63-p-rp-mo-ba8-br100,{},2024-08-28 08:52:55,2025-08-28 08:52:55.615892+00:00,DD,0,0,0,Valid review with genuine experience

We also tried the spicy Sichuan dumplings, which were decent but I felt like maybe there was a bit too much going on in the dumplings. It would be good to note that the dumplings had more flavours than you would usually expect from Chinese dumplings, and the spicy Sichuan dumplings didn\'t have the ""ma"" (numbing) sensation you may expect.\n\nThe braised pork noodles were decent, although the pulled pork was a little dry. They also provided unique drinks like Grapefruit Thyme Strawberry Green Tea, which nicely completed the meal.\n\nThey were attentive and offered us a new facemask when they noticed one of us dropped a facemask on the floor.

Seats are limited I would say about 20+ to 30 people max. They have counter seats as well as normal dining tables.\n\nOpening hours for lunch is from 11am - 3pm but I would say at about 12:20pm the place was packed and you probably would not be able to get seats so do come early!\n\nThe aesthetics here are fantastic. Its quite dimly lit so it really gives off a chill vibe and the menu is exceptionally cute! I love it!\n\nWe went for the lunch set as well as their all day 2 for $20 draft beers for Valentine's (might end soon).\n\nLunch set is at $17 and for that price you get one noodle, an iced drink as well as one of the dumpling types. Since I was there with a friend we decided to get different things so we could try out more.\n\nFor the noodles I got the Sichuan pork noodles which was exceptionally yummy and my friend got the miso mushroom. I personally really enjoyed the pork noodles. It wasn't overwhelmingly spicy. Just the right amount of kick. If you want it even spicier you can request for chilli oil and they will give it to you.\n\nFor the dumplings we ordered spicy sichuan and fried pierogi. My personal fave was the fried pierogi. Although it has fried bacon, truffle potato, caramelised onion and cheddar I could mainly taste the potato which I love. Its served on top of a dollop or Sriracha crema. I could eat 10 of these and still want more.\n\nDrinks wise I went for the longan osmanthus pu erh and I love it! Very refreshing and really comes with longan bits and jelly in the drink. Also its a tall glass so its worth it too.\n\nDraft beer was quite interesting we went for the dragon fruit beer and I forgot the other one but both were pleasant! Also wanted to commend the staff here, all very on the ball and gave great service!\n\nAll in all I would say I'd definitely be back for more here!""}",1,"['https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CqPxu_jBq41qi1sjOh0JR3rYycIKiJ7Q-3jbfxf396T2ALWT8p5RVzjSjnN-20VpVu9Ft1W7kQpqA47GkB02n2tod9Ot73TBxVZ7b1_rWTQ3bnAYW1I7DyAdSMQThz9pU1qVnKOw=w525-h394-p', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CbwtjSw2XppZC4RpLLRWIHFOLnOhAAT0YUl9CM7j6ZZLL32hR5tBOC9cvtRQFSHazMPAROuIS9qd0lu2Tzm2I-h0QmHAC46rYh2vH1wb1Yy05Gjz_e0Jtwc3V8GfIWZWp1VwI=w525-h394-p', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90C2t0_LbinEegQVqhHlIkGsgzNBuvnT0tLlE2oz_trJCScmun4tcukfgBvGtnmxVw9axBsMmgekfahMgJlvpIBxbY1B9OjA35HBsf6uG7dp0FZ4Q5dtQhq2fmK79JP57k2JL10=w525-h394-p', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90C7-_1c4mC8F_B_BIRc-wpbIrfTzblZQihfhuUKJqYf18jXo3oXgkb9o7S5XXMJ9tKigbbHfMsV91iHN18cM9QwDraFtbAXpn5ng33A95Ka-CdI1z7XlfCMhAtVFY_wU1w_plJq=w525-h394-p']",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/102086086595877957581/reviews?hl=en,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXQ_cNS8ZdaXEQIBA_bq2VlffXW4cYbp0hhvF0_DsnRpdaG1GI=w63-h63-p-rp-mo-ba5-br100,{},2023-08-29 08:53:08,2025-08-28 08:53:07.931678+00:00,DD,0,0,0,Content blocked by safety filters - classified as valid

Still, it was a great taco overall.\n\nMy only real complaint was the elotes. For the price, getting only one cob of corn felt a little disappointing. It was grilled rather than steamed or boiled, and compared to what I‚Äôm used to, it was pretty lightly seasoned. I usually expect elotes to be dripping in butter and spices this one felt a little bare, which was a letdown since elotes are one of my favorite Mexican foods.\n\nOverall, I can‚Äôt say anything bad about the place.

I decided on the Burrito Bowl and Birria Beef Tacos, and I must say, both dishes were a hit. Served hot and packed with flavor, the portions were satisfying and well-priced for the quality.\n\nWhile the overall ambience is pleasant, I found that the low ceiling on the second floor made conversations from neighbouring tables more noticeable.

I‚Äôve always preferred this over the loaded nachos as it's more satisfying and flavorful. The combination of beef, guacamole, salsa, egg, black beans, and pickled onions pairs perfectly with the nacho chips.\n\nI also ordered my favorites: the trinity mushroom and birria beef quesadillas. They never fail to amaze me. The quesadilla shell was crispy, with juicy meat and mushrooms inside, all topped with flavorful sauces.\n\nToday, I tried two new items. The first was the barbacoa lamb taco. I typically go for the Baja fish taco, but the lamb might replace it as my go-to. The lamb was meaty yet not overpowering, with a nice kick of spice. I also tried their frozen margarita, which was fantastic and will be a must-have moving forward. The flavors blended smoothly with the tequila, making it very refreshing. Sipping it while enjoying the mains really elevated the whole gastronomic experience.\n\nHowever, do note that weekday dinners and weekends can see long queues, and all members of your party must be present before being seated. The food preparation time can be a bit lengthy, but it‚Äôs worth the wait.\n\nArguably the best Mexican food in Singapore, I would highly recommend.""}",4,"['https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90C4fViesNMrqjTbz3MTgGjPBCvKLvj5QQCFQpzNVn59kVrvMjPkk7SfhG7QiUtCgPCIFw8F0fd3QCDdZ_sCvQWF3jHeAvitOZ9_UurS8KxcPYdmdqOa0CdcG2Px_K-pUmW2LxqR=w525-h394-p', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90B0WMsAMZvHDTANKiWiCA0ejokS1zzWqILJNW6RUKubMAJ5q8uOfGe3cOCqaOtP2PWz8GPGyBJyQNRvcMjZ-ZMrPLsjAT3_JMmAkEpbaPok6iFpb7mjmD0gldorQmyzKL24ZFvHPQ=w525-h394-p', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90AiNSAnBHezbmMHxpHvC44XURm8GGLE_b97AYyfutAmMOD8FmCXaC7iX5hCLgH_a6hBoipW9ipWzKS60FF2czDyV4JIez8F3e5Wi8HNUVg1M2qhjynnLL2IZL9lfJ4rAfbFju0=w525-h394-p', 'https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/geougc-cs/AB3l90CCNV37WAQ30p0mb1S58jlh5qa0AIluzFZ7FL3xkYCPXG7EZsyw3gvsQLSyNsJXc5DAzAmuoEXGS_XAEMU_39kdGRc5WW0RuUdVxKC7puFNDVZNCsVHwlOSVq4Zn2obLF3DrnwlXg=w525-h394-p']",https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/114331438677429094505/reviews?hl=en,https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXNHaGXgL3Ze4JBW9o3aZ9WeacOcwrJEbHkngXBwrR7DBxbaZOq=w63-h63-p-rp-mo-ba4-br100,{'en': {'text': 'Love u'}},2024-08-28 08:44:57,2025-08-28 08:44:56.942347+00:00,google_reviews,0,0,0,Valid review with genuine experience

Definitely the best mexican food I've had in Singapore, far better than Papi's Tacos and Muchachos in terms of both flavour and price.\n\nOrdered the elotes, mushroom quesadilla, chipotle chicken tacos, baja fish tacos and prawn tacos. The chipotle chicken was so flavourful (although there was quite a bit of chicken skin), the baja fish is a truly generous portion of crispy fish, and the prawns were good and crunchy. Loved their salsa and guac, which were fresh and had some kick to them. The hot sauces were also really tangy and tasty. Definitely not for those who cannot take spice though!\n\nSpent about 70 bucks for 3 people, which is pretty affordable imo! Was afraid of the queues after seeing previous reviews, and although the restaurant was small, there were seats on a sunday night between 6-7pm. Also helped that they are super efficient - we were in and out in 45mins.\n\nWill definitely be back to try the beef offerings and to have the chipotle chicken and baja fish again.

Same goes for the Beef Birria Tacos, the consomm√© was the absolute icing on top. They‚Äôre super generous with their portions and every bite was packed full of meat.\n\nThey offer up two of their own in-house chilli sauces for use when dining here. One red one green. Both sauces were pretty good but I preferred the green one more. That being said I didn‚Äôt really have the sauces with my food anyways because I find that it drowns out the banging flavour of the food itself.\n\nThe atmosphere and decor does not let down either. Although it doesn‚Äôt really pull you into the borders of Mexico, it still gives you the vibe of what you‚Äôre about to be served. And while the store may appear to be on the smaller side at first glance, it makes up for it by having two floors, doubling its seating capacity.\n\nThe drinks were pretty special too.

The quesadilla was excellent: packed with chicken and cheese, definitely not thin or skimpy, and nicely garnished.\n\nThe fish tacos were also solid, although the toppings were a little overpowering if you ate it blindfolded, you might not immediately guess it was fish. Still, it was a great taco overall.\n\nMy only real complaint was the elotes. For the price, getting only one cob of corn felt a little disappointing. It was grilled rather than steamed or boiled, and compared to what I‚Äôm used to, it was pretty lightly seasoned.

As I walked in, I was warmly greeted by their youthful staff, who maintained a friendly atmosphere throughout. The restaurant spans two storeys, and after a brief wait, I was seated on the second floor. Despite the afternoon heat, the cold water served at the table was a refreshing touch.\n\nAt Huevos, you‚Äôll need to approach the staff to place your order, which adds to the casual vibe. I decided on the Burrito Bowl and Birria Beef Tacos, and I must say, both dishes were a hit. Served hot and packed with flavor, the portions were satisfying and well-priced for the quality.\n\nWhile the overall ambience is pleasant, I found that the low ceiling on the second floor made conversations from neighbouring tables more noticeable. In my case, a group of four nearby was particularly loud, which slightly dampened the otherwise enjoyable experience. Nonetheless, this is a small quirk of the space rather than a reflection on the restaurant itself.\n\nHuevos is perfect for couples or small groups seeking delicious Mexican food in a quaint setting.

The combination of beef, guacamole, salsa, egg, black beans, and pickled onions pairs perfectly with the nacho chips.\n\nI also ordered my favorites: the trinity mushroom and birria beef quesadillas. They never fail to amaze me. The quesadilla shell was crispy, with juicy meat and mushrooms inside, all topped with flavorful sauces.\n\nToday, I tried two new items. The first was the barbacoa lamb taco. I typically go for the Baja fish taco, but the lamb might replace it as my go-to. The lamb was meaty yet not overpowering, with a nice kick of spice. I also tried their frozen margarita, which was fantastic and will be a must-have moving forward. The flavors blended smoothly with the tequila, making it very refreshing. Sipping it while enjoying the mains really elevated the whole gastronomic experience.\n\nHowever, do note that weekday dinners and weekends can see long queues, and all members of your party must be present before being seated.

If you love fish and strong flavours, you would love this! üåÆüëå\n\nü§§ Loaded Nachos (11/10)\nVery worth it, great for sharing. Didn‚Äôt even get a photo of it, was too excited to dive in. Has so many ingredients, refreshing, and SO GOOD. Will come back for this!!! Love the mix of guac, pico de gallo, meat, cheese, nachos‚Ä¶ ü§§üòãüòãüòãcan share between 2-3 people.\nPlease try this!! (Imo i like it more than the fish tacos)\n\nü§§ Kids Quesadilla Jr\nA serving of 4 quesadillas filled with cheese, bacon, corn.. all the things kids will love. Quite huge, can share with 2 kids!\n\nWe came on Saturday at 1pm, queued for about 25-30 mins, food arrived after 10~ mins.

Definitely the best mexican food I've had in Singapore, far better than Papi's Tacos and Muchachos in terms of both flavour and price.\n\nOrdered the elotes, mushroom quesadilla, chipotle chicken tacos, baja fish tacos and prawn tacos. The chipotle chicken was so flavourful (although there was quite a bit of chicken skin), the baja fish is a truly generous portion of crispy fish, and the prawns were good and crunchy. Loved their salsa and guac, which were fresh and had some kick to them. The hot sauces were also really tangy and tasty. Definitely not for those who cannot take spice though!\n\nSpent about 70 bucks for 3 people, which is pretty affordable imo! Was afraid of the queues after seeing previous reviews, and although the restaurant was small, there were seats on a sunday night between 6-7pm. Also helped that they are super efficient - we were in and out in 45mins.\n\nWill definitely be back to try the beef offerings and to have the chipotle chicken and baja fish again.

Together with the crispy guanciale, the fragrance from the pork fat and the crunch, just wow. Had some slightly larger black peppercorns that gave it a bit of a kick when I took a bite.\n\nBolognese ravioli had an extremely rich tasting filling, from the beef cheek, bone marrow as well as the sun-dried tomatoes. The green oil (I'm guessing basil infused oil) was barely there but it was fine since the ravioli was tasty enough.\n\nThe Stracciatella, might seem slightly pricey given how you only get 2 pieces for the price but definitely a must try. In fact, I was very tempted to get the charred bone marrow toast as well, especially seeing the bone marrow being prepped while sitting at the counter seat.\n\nA little weird for most (I'm assuming) but good olive oil on gelato is such an insane combi. Milk gelato was great but the olive oil gave the nutty taste and the crunchy salt flakes helped enhance the overall flavour of the milk gelato as well as the olive oil.\n\nService was excellent as well. The female service staff (didn't notice the nametag) was so friendly and didn't chase us to make an order despite the queue being insanely long.
