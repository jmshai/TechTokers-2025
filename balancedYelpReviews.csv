I have been a few times for dinner, but, the mojitos got to me.  Some sort of sumptuous chicken comes to mind. Brunch here is worth the wait.  They have great CRAB CAKES!  I love their crab cakes benedict!  Here, they have only slight breading- not easy to find in Chicago- and were absolutely huge!  The mojitos always go  great with them, and the coffee is nice and strong too! Helpful walking hint- If you are freezing- stop in here for drink and make sure to hit the ladies room.  It is not fancy, however, it sits between the kitchen and the furnace room (I believe) and is about as warm as a steam sauna.  Extremely toasty and comforting when you are trying to make your way down windy, busy Irving Park!",4,4,4,3,0,WaIbupMGDBi5B3SChsUH8A

I then sat down yesterday, Tuesday, and sat at a picnic table that was shared with other people around lunch. We all had to share these brown paper towel rolls, all with other people's greasy fingers on them as well...Im not a fancy person, but having my own individual napkin is like a minimum eating need that I have at a restaurant..Maybe this is how they do it in Korea, but not COOl at all..or sanitary.   So,,the chicken was just completely unremarkable..Just crispy fried chicken..a little peppering I think..but just chicken..Not bready like KFC, just skin on chicken fried up.   Maybe I should have added a few hundred more calories and got it with the BBQ or Seol sassy sauce to hide the taste of the chicken, but blowing my diet on fried chicken was bad enough. I ate about half, and threw out the rest.     I would give the food a 1 star,,overpriced and not good.

But that is not necessarily a bad thing. Shopping on MM with a friend from out of town and the windows of the Grand Lux Cafe looked mighty inviting from down there. So off we went in search of salad and iced tea. Simple Simon. What we were told would be a 25 minute was actually closer to 18 minutes.  And we snagged seats in that big bay window.  So far, so good. We both ordered salads and somewhere along the line, something happened. It took 31 minutes to get our food. We were mildly annoyed but our server owned up to the fact that there had been a mis-communication and offered his apologies. A simple ""I'm sorry"" goes a long way with me. On his heels was the manager, who also apologized. Nice. I enjoyed a lovely grilled shrimp caesar salad (shrimp grilled perfectly) and a raspberry lemonade that tasted freshly made (meaning not from a mix). Then our server came back and told us the manager wanted to buy us dessert to thank us for our understanding. Key Lime Pie!  Bueller?  Anyone? That was a really lovely gesture and it added a star to this review. We weren't looking for anything fancy.  just a nice lunch.  We got that. And good customer service as well.

3/23/2009,HfnTl-Yj1Blp7abbe4,aiWlaHWNvr99nZaI9pmyMQ,"I was really torn what to rate Publican. On the one hand, some of the food was insanely good - the smoked trout was unbelievable, and the pork belly amazing. Some food was pretty good - the ribs were good, but overcooked (although the flavor made up for the slightly tough texture), the ham was good, but I have had better, and the oysters were good, but only insofar as they were good for Chicago standards. I suppose my biggest beef was the price - the food was good, but local produce should be good and flavorful - but the mark-up was insane. What let them down the most, though, was the service - absolute, total incompetent crap service. Our server ignored us for most of the night and when he did bother with us (we were a table of 10) he had us confused - we had worked out what we were going to share and what we were not, and told him so, yet he kept asking ""for the table or for yourself"" and ""the man over there already ordered that."" He also took 3 orders and left, and we had to go after him to tell him that 3 orders for 10 people was not sympatico. Then when the food came out it was a disaster - the dude who brought it to the table stood at the end whispering (literally!) ""who had the oysters"", when I said I didn't know, he'd have to ask up the table he just stood there and then loaded the food all in front of me! My husband also had to order his drink 3 times before it turned up. Publican - work it out - you have the potential to be good, don't screw it up with screwy servers.

I have never been there before and heard great things so thought I'd give it a go. We arrived around 7:30 PM on a Friday so I knew it would be busy and didn't expect to be seated for a long time. The Hostess was very nice and said we may dine at their communal tables or at the bar. We said ""thanks"" but prefer a table reservation and asked about the wait. She said it would be 40 minutes (which was awesome) and entered my name and telephone # in their system. We went to the bar and waited for our table. Here's where Sunda dropped the ball. An hour later, I went over to find our hostess to inquire about our reservation. She said our table will be ready shortly. After another 20 minutes I went back to our hostess to inquire about our table only to have her say we have NO RESERVATION and the only time she can accommodate us is at 10:30 pm. This was a Twilight Zone experience and a total insult so I asked to speak with the Manager. The Manager didn't even look in the system and said ""yep"" we can get you in at 10:30pm. I asked about my name and telephone # in the sysem.... and she said we dont have a reservation for you! I asked my date if I misheard something and she said ""no, the hostess said we would be seated in 40 minutes"" Knowing this was going nowhere (and  basically being called a liar) we decided to take our business elsewhere and will tell everyone about our less than spectacular experience. So crazy. Usually people write bad review AFTER they sit down and eat. LOL.

4/20/2009,WAYxeOkYqSIOnHP328mc7g,n2UsVjISE1nOow63cm3auQ,"This little Piggy went to Fulton Market... I am one big food whore. And last week, I got porked. Hard. Oh, Publican. I've been longing to experience you for so long, and I didn't even know what you had in store. This place was all the rage on Yelp and beyond, so it mattered not what was on the menu -- I had to try it. But I couldn't afford it myself, so naturally I had to wait until a date suggested we try it. Glorious, that worked out for me. (God, I really AM a food whore.) When I found out the menu featured beer, shellfish and pork, I was actually a little nervous. Three things I know next to nothing about and rarely seek out on my own. But I went with a capable companion who was practically a pro. We skipped the oysters and seafood entirely, so we could focus on the main event: oink, oink, oink. (Note: If you're vegan, what the HELL are you doing within five blocks of Publican? Get a clue and go to Handlebar or something.) We had the ""pickles,"" which date liked best but I found a bit revolting, a platter of three different hams, a pork shoulder and chorizo stew, sauteed ramps with mint and walnuts, and a beet salad that was beets and aioli. Andthatsit. From the crusty bread and fabulous butter that started the meal to the last bite of beet, the food was nice, with great flavor. (Another note: If you don't like salt, run away. Now. I'd personally eaten a Lean Cuisine at lunch and was just getting started with my sodium intake.) We also had a big bottle of beer -- inhumanly large, really; only wine should come in containers that big -- that went nicely with everything we ate. But I could have been drinking anything and thought it paired well. So. Overall, I did enjoy the Publican for the experience. The decor took barnyard chic to a new level; I found the ""booths"" along the restaurant's perimeter especially entertaining (the tops of the patrons' heads were BARELY visible over their stable-door confines). And there were paintings of abnormally large hogs adorning the walls. You can read any number of other reviews for more insight on the interior. My biggest beef (er, pork?) with the Publican: the crowd. I say this with as much love as I can muster, but the place seemed full of trend whores. And not in the charming, curious way that I am (though I may be biased). I didn't feel cool enough to be at Publican. The high-top tables, corral-style booths and long, communal tables were all filled with incredibly fashionable, incredibly loud people. They were jovial and obnoxious and, though they waved at me from down the table when we were seated, clearly did not give one shit that they made normal conversation completely impossible for the rest of us. Meaning me. As I write this review, it seems I am growing less and less excited about the Publican, so I'm going to end this on a high note. Despite the fact that I couldn't figure out which stall to use in the semicommunal bathroom area, they did have soap and hand lotion from C.O. Bigelow near the cleaning troughs. I mean sinks. Still, I went weeeeeeeeee, wee, wee-wee-wee-wee ALL the way home.",3,12,11,15,0,LMaoM2Ue2BR_HI9ba3JsZg

As for the food, this is really some good sushi.  I don't know what the nay-sayers are harping on.  I mean, the fish here is of very high quality.  You really can't run a sushi restaurant on this main drag of Broadway and be shelling out tainted flounder-- too many people would know in a short period of time that the best sushi place in Boystown sells rotten goods. I'm sure some rolls are better than others, but so far the Emerald Roll is my fave.  I think it was salmon, avocado, tempura crunchy goodness, and wasabi mayo on top.  Not exactly healthy, but thank God they've learned to adapt to Americans' desires for rich, hyper-caloric food everywhere we go. One appetizer dish that you will probably glaze over on the menu, but is fantastic, is the shitake mushroom, gluten, and tree fungus plate.  I know, doesn't that sound appetizing?  Well, it may sound like they're selling a pile of crap, and when it comes out, it does kind of resemble a mound of dog doo, but trust me, this is some tasty fung.  Anyone who loves mushrooms will have to love this.  Last time we ordered a second plate it was so good. So in conclusion, leave your snobbish east and west coast perceptions of what is cool and good at the door.  This place isn't trying too hard, it's just trying to not be like every other sushi bar that resembles the interior of a 19th century Japanese bath house.  The food is divine, and I think we can all deal with a $5 corkage fee, no?",5,1,1,0,0,1QKqtC4vML3QhkrSzwR_tQ

Chalk me up for my first Royster with the Oyster event. We were lucky enough to get on the list for the Tuesday slurp off - twelve contestants slurpin' down a dozen oysters as quickly as possible without using their hands. I feel like I did okee for a noob - suckin' down 9 oysters before ""Two-at-a-time Tony"" next to me put his big paw in the air as the winner. I felt honored just to be in the same field as a living legend. We came back on Friday for the big tent event. Great bands playing da blues, sudsy brews and amazing food - including a butterific lobster roll, fried jumbo shrimp, tasty jambalaya, and, of course, cold as the North Sea oysters. It was a pearl of a time and I'm already looking forward to next year. No worries though, I'll be back in at Shaw's oyster bar when that goober mood strikes.",4,3,2,3,0,dKcO9OQ44RPRlkWe-vToFA

I figured most resturants would be more than happy to have a bigger party as this brings in more revenue for them.  However this was not the case here, to top it off when we arrived the place was pretty much empty.  People didn't start coming in until we left.  Now for a resturant that charges an arm and a leg you would think that they would be a little more accomidating.  I was just a guest at the dinner, but if it was up to me I would have cancelled the reservation and took my business someplace else. As far as the food, for starter I had the ceasar salad, which was not really all that.  It was pretty much pieces of lettuce with anchovies on top with a piece of bread on the side.  The bread was good, however I really didn't get to eat much of mine, as the waitress said that they are unable to give us an extra bread for my 8 year old  niece. I was really supprised by that, we were more than willing to pay for the piece of bread, but she said no we would have to order a whole $15 crappy salad, just to get a piece of bread. Then I tried the pea soup, after reading all the great reviews on it. It was ok.  It was good, but there was something about it that you could only have a sip or two of. I can't put my finger on it but no one at the table was able to finish the soup. Which was kind of suprsing because the portions are fit for a mouse. The main dish was great. I had the chicken. It was awsome.  Everyone at the table pretty much devoured their dish.  However it was not the least bit filling.  Then on to desert.  I had the pineapple, which was blah... I don't think anyone was really blown away with the desert. I must admit that the busboys were very attentive, and our glasses were always full. Everytime a dish came the waitress did come and explain to everyone what everyrthing was, which was somewhat annoying as everything she told us was on the menu. Overall, I must admit for the amount we spent (about $1000) for a party of 8, I am deeply disappointed.  We could have easily went to another establishment and have been accomidated.  For that kind of price I think we should have left full and satisfied, which we were not.

On to the food... The food here is always great.  I mean ALWAYS! I usually opt for the fruit as my side of choice as is always comes in the form of large slices of fresh fruit.  I've had the eggs Benedict, pancakes, French toast, crepes, and corn beef hash and I definitely give 5 stars to all of that.  My boyfriend opts for the hardier omelets and skillet choices that I enjoy taking one indulgent bite of with great delight. This place is a true gem in the oasis that is the South Loop.  I've been eagerly waiting for years for this neighborhood to develop more of a feeling of a warmer community and its places like this, The Bongo Room, Opera, O'Malley's, and a few other places that are giving this neighborhood hope.  The one star was knocked off for 2 reasons, one being the wait (mentioned earlier) and the other is the fact that brunch cocktails are not served.  I think its BYOB but I just feel weird bringing vodka to a brunch location at noon.  Brown paper bags should never see daylight in my opinion.",4,1,2,1,0,CwPi6NVuJIZZx4IBcTekFQ

3/1/2008,If5W,0ISAHQe1Tojcpj8RqVccgw,"It's a Chicago classic that the fella hadn't been to yet, so we headed down to Pilsen today for some lunch.  As other reviewers have noted, it's been here since the 50's and is family owned, so it really is kind of a  must stop. As usual on a weekend, there was a huge line running to the door, but we were seated within 15 minutes.  Hot chips, salsa, and complimentary chicken soup as soon as you sit down, drinks take only a few minutes to arrive.  I've eaten here over the years and have pretty much enjoyed everything, but today I had chicken enchiladas verde and the fella had the steak taco dinner.  Oddly, when the fella tried to order 2 steak and one machacado taco, the waiter said ""no, all three the same."" Now, I'm not new to this place, so I know this isn't an actual rule, but it was really busy so we went along with it and he just got his 3 steak tacos.  These things happen on occasion here, depending. If it isn't busy, stick to your guns and they will generally accommodate you. Food was, as always, pretty good and incredibly inexpensive.  The fella wasn't a huge fan of the salsa, feeling that it was a bit watery and flavorless.  His tacos were very good, my enchiladas good, but a bit on the dry side.  I would have requested more verde had I been able to catch the waiter's attention. Service tends to be a bit haphazard on the very, very busy weekends, so I tend to prefer eating here on a weeknight. It's an old favorite, but I think it's pretty standard as far as Mexican restaurants go in Chicago.  When I'm down here, I'll probably always head here first, but I usually don't go out of my way for it.  More like a 3 1/2 to 4 star restaurant for me, but I'm going to knock it down to a 3 as this isn't the first time I've felt somewhat jerked around by the wait staff here.",3,2,0,0,0,cQnY_VneZisfUAqcbuEuKg
2/3/2010,puVPFGTocn,TylOr9YYTV3znqIvH7kdmQ,"I think the difference between 'Mediterreanean' and 'Persian' is the price. There are some differences in the cuisine but for the most part I think it's the same but Persian restaurants have higher quality ingredients. Think filet kabob instead of beef and you get the picture. Obviously, since I am a fan of it it's not too bad. Noon O Kabab has some pretty good selections, and I give it an A for effort since it does try to set itself apart from the other Mediterranean/Persian restuarants in the city and on this strip. I went with a friend of mine and split the hummus which was pretty good. A smooth consistency and a pretty tasty standout. I had the Fesenjan which is a pomegranate stew with chicken. I ordered it because it was something different....well like I said, A for effort. My friend went with a more traditional approach and got the steak and chicken kabob combination. I was much more pleased with that flavor. If it was a little on the pricey side, again you pay for the higher quality and it does show. I will probably return but get something more along the normal route.",3,1,0,2,0,8j97C2qR95tvpbGtoFxEAw

The cheese was thick and cold and again made the bun soggy. Hubby had the tueben. Sauerkraut was cold and the bun soggy. Tasted like a cold sauerkraut sandwich. The Diet Coke was good. You know how McDonald's has the ""good"" Diet Coke, well so does Hot Doug's. My husband says the Diet Coke was the best thing we had from there. Me, well, the fries were better than the soda.

I've been a fan of Bayless since the early 2000s when I avidly watched his cooking show on PBS that was introduced to me by my roommate of Mexican descent. I fell in love with his dishes and his genuine enthusiasm for Mexican cuisine. With him, Mexican food became more than rice and refried beans. It was elevated to haute cuisine and celebrated the way French and Italian cuisine is celebrated in the finest restaurants in the US. A few years later, I decided to go to Chicago to visit a friend and he fulfilled my dream of dining at Frontera Grill. The food was sublime and I was eager to go back. Thanks to a conference I had a trip to Chicago planned and paid for. Naturally Frontera Grill was my first destination. We started with GUACAMOLE and freshly-made tortilla chips. The guacamole was smooth and creamy, dotted with cubed tomatoes and diced onions. But what really made this were the freshly-made tortilla chips. Warm and fresh, and deliciously salty, they elevated this to a whole new level. We thought it would be more fun to get a bunch of little appetizers to share, which turned out to be the right idea as we got to try a bunch of different things. I swear each one was a perfect little bite. STREET FOOD TRIO: Two pieces each: potosinas (fresh cheese, avocado, crema, Tamazula), pork flautas (guajillo salsa, peashoots), sopes (shredded beef, roasted tomato, green chile). I loved everything, but especially the sopes. The shredded beef was amazing! MOLE POBLANO ENCHILADAs: Gunthorp free-range chicken, grill-roasted red onions.   I thought I hated mole sauce. No, it turns out that when it's made correctly, I *love* mole. There was a deep rich flavor that was accented by a hint of cacao. Other mole sauce had tasted as if people accidentally dropped a batch of chocolate into the sauce, but not at Frontera. I wanted more. TACOS AL CARBON: Wood-grilled chicken, roasted poblano rajas, guacamole, two salsas. Yum, nothing like tacos to fill up whatever little empty corners of your stomach. For dessert, we got DUO DE FLANES: A duo of caramel custards: classic Mexican vanilla bean & Gentle Breezes honey with Bayless Garden lemon verbena. Honey-poached apricot & honeycomb candy. The honeycomb candy stole the show. Crispy and lightly sweet, it provided the perfect textural counterpart to the soft flan. Rick Bayless, you rock my socks. Move to NY.

If you go early in the evening you can get a booth (which is much nicer than the tables) without a reservation.  Otherwise definitely call ahead. The service is always top notch when we've been here.Once things pick up there is a live Spanish guitar performance up front (which you can hear through out the restaurant).

We attended the flower and garden show on complimentary tickets, parked off the pier at a meter AND ate at Fox and Obel for way less than the inflated prices on the Pier. So whats the gripe?We thought we'd take advantage of Fox & Obel's 2 hrs parking free w/$20 purchase - great deal! So we moved the car (meter ran out) and, after purchasing some items, we settled into their cafe for a late lunch. I ordered their vegetable pistou soup. Easy, right? I love pistou - the lightness, the flavor...yummy! I couldn't wait. And with fresh bread - how can you lose? Here's how.The soup arrived without a pretty swirly pistou floating on the surface of the clear broth and large chunks of veggies lurking below. Whaat? I double checked the menu -- yes, a parsley pistou. Ok, I asked the cashier and she swifly gave me a little cup of pistou and even added a little extra when she asked if I'd like more. Who would turn that down?So I unceremoniously dump it on my soup. Yumminess, here I come! But the soup arrived barely lukewarm. I hadn't noticed this before. My husband was keeping score, this was strike two. So I carry the soup to the register and tell her that it needs to be heated. No complaint just a request to have it remedied.So she returns it to my table, warmer and the pistou has melted into the soup. Thats fine because it will taste yummy! But wait....there's no flavor in that bowl even with the extra pistou. I add salt and pepper, and it doesn't help. The veggies are tasteless. Booo...and thats strike three. What is this, a Cubs game? (just kidding, I love my Cubbies)The bread was good but the main event was lacking. Surprisingly so given the quality of many of their other offerings. My husband's meal was great but he can give them more stars in his review. The guy who actually ""served"" the soup (he kind of dropped it off and walked off quickly without a word) seemed pretty disinterested. The cashier was pretty nice, though, as was the woman who gave me the pistou.Overall I like Fox & Obel -- overpriced in general? YES! But still, you can find some unusual items. But I'm not reviewing the store - just the cafe. Maybe they should just rename it baseball soup.",3,0,0,0,1,n3VjBryfinjRG1W3LWsPBQ

We had gone for my friend's birthday, and needless to say, I was embarrassed.  The whole thing was a joke and I think this restaurant is a little full of themselves.  I can deal with the snobby attitude on the portion sizes and even the ""we serve fatty beef"" response, but then the flavors better be damn good.  And they simply weren't.

This is the place for the greatest steaks in Chicago!  Why?  Because of how they cut the meat.  We ordered rib eyes.  They're NOT the standard extremely thick cuts, round and tall, with all fat trimmed off.  They're moderately thick, with the side strip of meat left on and the fat left tied to the meat.  The fat is where the flavor is!!!  That's why you want marbled steaks.  Here, you get the narrow strip of fat surrounding much of the meat.  Served on their sizzling platters.  It was heavenly.  Now I understand why my father-in-law, when he was alive, loved Ruth's Chris'.  He raised cattle and sold them to the packing company that supplied Ruth's Chris'.  He knew great meat when he had it and this is great meat. My suggestion:  Give it a try.  If you prefer the fat-free version served elsewhere, fine.  Your call.  I like them too.  Love the steaks at Morton's and Ditka's.  But if you've worked through many of Chicago's finest steakhouses, try Ruth's Chris'.  At a minimum it'll expand your knowledge of how steaks can be served. The salad was nice, the sides were good (what steakhouse doesn't have good spinach?), and dessert is adequate if you're still hungry.  But this is now my #1 place for steaks - damn it was good.",4,5,2,0,0,n-mj6IJkWyCu4BuD2dvm0A

I've never seen anything like the options Hot Dougs has. HD has the most outlandish ingredients one could possibly fathom, but it works. I didn't go too crazy and got a spinach and mozzarella chicken sausage with sun dried tomatoes and smoked provolone cheese. Hot Dougs has a specialty all their own and I'm glad I tried it.

I was visiting friends who live in Chicago, and they took me to dinner here, saying it's ""The"" Chicago Pizza. Went just before 7 on a Tuesday night and it was pretty busy understandably - wait time was 30-45 minutes, but you can pre-order, so our pizza was ready almost as soon as we sat down - it was really not a bad waiting experience at all. We got a medium for us two girls and my friend's husband - she and I had two pieces and that is PLENTY, and her husband had 3 - I think there was even leftover, so don't worry about not being satisfied! Crust is flaky and nice, dough is perfectly doughy, and the cheese is great - (as far as I can tell) good quality mozzarella, and plenty of it, without being sickening. Got green peppers and tomatoes - peppers were delish and tomatoes were decent, my friend said he loved his Canadian bacon. I was afraid I'd feel sick after eating such ""decadent"" pizza but it was not greasy at all, and although I normally feel disgusting after eating junk food, I fully enjoyed this pizza and didn't feel like I'd pigged out or anything. A real winner, this place! It was seriously really good. That night they were giving out coupons for $5 off your next visit, and since my friends live there and there were a lot of out-of-towners, they got a lot of these people's coupons who couldn't use them! The only negative I guess I really have would be the tables are pretty close together..which is a littleee weird sitting near strangers, but hey, what can you do. It didn't really diminish the experience for me in the least. I will definitely be eating at Giordano's next time I'm in Chicago!",5,0,0,0,0,ms5ge1XY9-Alu7HkybAMdQ

Long story short: service and kitchen were both really slow and weirdly-paced, resulting in a drawn-out experience that left some of us thirsty, some of us hungry and all of us a little bummed out. We went with a group of 6, after making a reservation for a recent Saturday night. The reservation-taker on the phone was adamant that we were all there by 7:15. Fair enough. We did this, but still weren't seated until 7:30, despite passing by other empty, set tables. It's a weird combination of byo-wine-only and full bar. We ordered a round of mojitos before dinner, since only one of us remembered their bottle --to share among 5 drinkers. I had the strawberry, and thought it was really good. I might even have ordered another if the waiter hadn't disappeared for such long stretches.   Food-wise, the apps (empanadas, chorizo, and yucca) were really good, and came out really fast. Dinner-wise, our good luck ended. Two of us ordered the fish soup (Saturday special) but were served the catfish entree instead. We managed to glad down our waiter after several efforts, and corrected the order, urging the rest of the group to go-ahead and start. Well, but the time they were finished (15-20 minutes or so) our fish soup was nowhere in site. We decided to cancel it all together, since everyone was nice enough to share what they had--since they give you more than enough food, we were sated, just sort of bummed that we never received what we ordered. Other service quibbles: slow to remove dirty plates, bring new silverware, refill water and it took the chimichurri sauce 3 requests to arrive. Oh well, at least it came out at all. The food was overall ok, but hard to enjoy given the service issues. I'd head to Tango Sur next time I need my tons of meat South American steakhouse fix...",2,2,0,0,0,2WoMT3wSpp9vxZeTv6u-cw

I'll tell you how it came to be with this Crisp-y love affair... Okay okay, bad Crisp pun. But really now, folks. Crisp is for real. After the many reviews that I've read and the number of times that I failed to get there by their 9PM closing hour, I finally found myself standing in line to order some of the most delicious finger food ever. EVER. Now I've had my fair share of chicken, wings in particular. Crisp takes poultry to a whole new level. Something about the crunchiness, or ""crisp""iness if you will, of the wings makes them so divine...and they aren't, like, breaded or anything. Weird. But that's not all! Crisp offers three sauces. On this visit, which was also my first, my girlfriend and I tried the Seoul Sassy and Crisp BBQ. Out of all the chicken that I've eaten, the Seoul Sassy somehow manages to leap over almost all of the competition. It's a simple, but perfectly executed, sauce that consists of ginger, soy sauce, garlic, and other seasonings and is topped with scallions. Maybe it's the familiar flavors [I'm a Chinaman], but it definitely hits all the right spots, and then some. The Crisp BBQ was, how do I say this, unexpectedly hot. It wasn't over-the-top ghost chili pepper hot. But it did have an interesting smokey taste to it. Yeah, smokey. We also ordered the Baby Buddha Bowl with beef. The reviews are a little much on these bad boys. It's a real simple dish with rice, veggies, and your selection of meat. It's really hard to mess this one up... Now about halfway through the meal I began to think about how this review would turn out. I liked the wings, but the Buddha Bowl was just okay. Do I give em a four? Are they worthy of the five star status? The deciding factors were the chicken and............. SERVICE!! The guys here rock. They were very welcoming and offered personal opinions and fan favorites. The Crispy Men answered questions about ingredients and even made small talk to pass the time. Stellar service and delicious food. I'll definitely Check-in again.

I took my girlfriend here on our first date even though she had never had sushi before and now she begs me to go here. Its a BYOB which makes it an awesome place to have a romantic place to have a fantastic meal and a bottle of wine. Or if you prefer the man date and just like sushi, I have even seen some bachelors sling a 24 pack in here and bro it up. Hey, I can't hate on em when I'm there because they know good food. It's a combination of mostly Sushi and Thai food that leaves you wanting more. So don't worry if you don't like raw fish, there are plenty of choices on the Thai side that will help you out. For starters, get some rolls of your choosing (I suggest the Philly or vegas rolls). move on to the main dishes and go for some curry plates is my reccommendation. Hot n Spicy is always done nicely for me. I have never tried any of their desserts so I can't give an honest opinion on what it would taste like. The atmosphere is what you would expect it to be like...trendy. I saw the movie Lost in Translation and thought about going to Indie. I never thought I would say watching a Bill Murray movie would make me want raw fish, but when you think about it they do both stink if you wait too long to consume. The music they play makes you feel like you sat through one long song that reminds you of swimming underwater. The atmosphere relies heavily on uncomfortable looking furniture and dark mysterious lighting. The wait staff is usually very nice and happy, but sometimes takes a long time to bring out your order because they have a small kitchen and smaller staff. Be patient though, the food is awesome.

I think this place is worth maybe one hour wait at most..... but I think people wait longer because there are a lot of tourists who come here from far away, and it'd be ridiculous to not wait, since they're already here. I'm a BIG fan of foie gras, and that is one of the reasons why I want to eat at Hot Doug's. But expect fancy preparation of foir gras, that's all I'm saying. It's not bad, worth a try. Very interesting to incorporate foir gras in hot dogs I must say. My friend and I ordered 80% of their menu... spent close to $100...I mean, go big or go home right? Might as well if we spent 2.5 hours of our lives waiting to get in. Some hot dogs are good, but some are just like ""what the f*uck did I just put in my mouth?"" So you just gotta try all of them I guess. But I must warn you, it'll cost ya. Towards the end I felt like a blood vessel popped due to overload in grease. (yes, we ordered duck fat fries, and they're good). So, a good strategy to attack this place, is to bring a bunch of friends, order one of each on the menu.

I am a HUGE wine connoisseur and I was incredibly unimpressed with this place. I finally went on a late Sunday afternoon in early March on a date after wanting to go to this place since I moved here. When my date and I walked in, we were seated with a large group of people we didn't know which was a little awkward, but I thought Oh well, it's a wine bar...it should be fine. Anyway, the waiter asked what we'd like to drink. I was in the mood for a red wine, and my date didn't have a preference, so we went for one of the more moderately priced wines. We were perplexed on what type of cheeses to get, so I asked the waiter for some suggestions on what to order that what compliment the wine. He gave us some suggestions, and naturally him being the expert, we took them. He brought us the plate and both my date and I did not like a single one of them!! It was obvious we didn't care for them because we pretty much left the entire cutting board of cheeses untouched. The waiter never asked any questions, or if everything was OK , nada! But he did ask if we wanted anything else? Well of course we do, we're still hungry!!! So, we chose the meats (ourselves this time!) and ordered a meat tray, olives and a few breads, They were OK, nothing to rave about,especially for the price. I'm not exaggerating, but there was hardly enough meat on the cutting board to make a small sandwich. By this time, we were both disgusted and unimpressed with everything, so we asked for the check and then left. I felt so bad for my date, and he felt awful too. Poor guy kept apologizing, when I chose the place! Thankfully, we went to and had a delicious meal, dessert and wine somewhere else for less than $85 dollars. I'm sorry, but I should never walk into a restaurant pay $105.00 tab and still be hungry...or tipsy for that matter. Tragic.",2,0,0,0,1,boE4Ahsssqic7o5wQLI04w

I returned to Kinzie Chop House last night with the friend who initially recommended it a couple years ago.  While it was still a fantastic meal, I was slightly disappointed that the ambiance had not held up to my previous visit.  That is not to say the restaurant doesn't offer great service and a very classy dining experience but there was a certain flair to my first visit that lacked this time around. Things that remained true - the meal was perfectly timed.  As we finished our appetizer, our salads arrived and moments after placing the last bite of my delicious salad, my entree was being delivered piping hot.  The food, itself, was as fantastic as I remembered.  We started with the calamari.  It was certainly one of the better calamari orders I have had in recent years.  I especially enjoyed the Cajun flavored dipping sauce.  Next I had the Caesar salad.  It was deliciously topped with seasoned croutons that had quite a bite!  For my entree, I ordered the beef medallions.  The beef was excellent itself but the addition of the mushroom cabernet was simply blissful.  I also enjoyed every last bit of the bacon and scallion mashed potatoes.  For dessert, I had the rum cheesecake.  Despite being incredibly full by then, it was insanely hard to put down the fork.  It was amazing. Things that I missed - while our server was very nice and tended to us well, there was just that little something extra the last visit that I missed this time.  It is all in the small details.  There was no request to hang my jacket, nobody pulled out my seat, and there wasn't that flair of communication from the server to leave us in salivating anticipation of our meal.  Now, the absence of these things are not detrimental to our dinner.  Our service was still stellar.  It just is hard to be objective when the service blew you out of the water before.  I went into the evening expecting the same and felt a slight tinge of disappointment.   Even on an off day, Kinzie is still a premiere chop house that has my affection.  I look forward to a return.",4,1,0,0,0,rnjz2KNgsQ2YaC_kjeuuAQ

Some thoughts: - The host a was a pretty chill guy. Yeah, he wore skinny jeans, but despite this, he was competent and friendly. - Chicken and waffle definitely lived up to the reputation.Well seasoned, light batter that was properly fried so it actually stayed on the chicken, and not over fried so the chicken is absolutely succulent. -free little samples of blue berry scones or muffins. Nice touch, and they were tasty. -Strong coffee, great floral green tea. Only negative is that the coffee didn't stay filled. My mom had to ask for two refills. -Attentive, non-obtrusive wait staff. Greeted the table promptly, made recommendations without being pushy and was familiar with the menu. Some kid threw a plate of food when I was there, and I would have never known expect ma saw it. Everything was cleaned quickly with no fuss or disturbance. I'll come back for the whiskey menu and a non brunch meal for sure.

We arrived and the table had a messy scattering of forks and a few random glasses. We had to practically beg to get silverware and wine glasses for the whole party. We also had to share menus. The waiter pretty much avoided our table most of the night. It took over an hour to get our appetizers and our entrees arrived about an hour and fifteen minutes after we had ordered them. We had to bolt our food and get out for the next thing we were doing.They just didn't seem to have the capacity, or frankly, the desire to do a good job for our group.In sum, go if you have a party of one or two.

Love this place.  I came here the other night for about the 7th time this calendar year.  I would have given this place 5 stars back in May when I first came here, but I've been busy.  Why do I keep coming back you ask?  Because it's that good. Let's look at the Top 3 things I like about  this restaurant: 1) The atmoshphere.  Cool location, an energetic vibe, and super warm and knowledgeable staff.  They aren't too pushy, and they get a feel for you and the group that you're with rather quickly. They always pop up at the right time in a conversation, and they know their wines up and down, side to side.  These guys must go through 6 months of training before actually being assigned their first table. Some  of the best in the buinsess.   2) Versatility.  Over the past year I've met up here with Friends from college I hadn't seen in years, dates with girls who weren't worthy of a  Graham Elliot type evening, but were able to walk out all the better for it when it was all said and done, business dinners, and a party.  You can bring family members here when you are looking for a place to take them for the night when they come to visit. Feel free to suggest to your boss to talk Q4 strategy here. This place has got your back, no matter what you have going on. 3) Staying power.  This place will be here for a long time. This won't be a big city restaurant that is hot for 18 months to a year and then flames out as being a place that is no longer hip to go to because ""only tourists like that place.""  That to me is a sign of a top notch restaurant. I knew it the second I first stepped foot in it. As far as food goes, it is excellent, top-notch! I've had everything on the menu, as it changes every now and then. It's all fantastic.   The menu is unique in that it offers dishes that combine several foods you wouldn't expect to be grouped together. For example, ""The Wisconsin Cheddar Risotto""  which consists of green apples, glazed onions, bacon, and cheez-its.   Just writing about it I can still taste it now. It is surprisingly delicious and all of their dishes follow suit.  If you want to change things up a bit and try a new  place and Graham Elliot is one of your options, you can't go wrong, I promise.  Enjoy!",5,3,1,1,0,LlHEzxQTiiLJokn2tli35A

1/5/2010,KysbodIWv7WOSNG7WmlyuQ,Q_FiW_EgCcDIwKi3EBJR1g,"So let me first preface this by saying I was here wth a group of ten people on NYE. Large groups are very awkward in this place, as my back was sandwiched against the side of someone else's table. I hope I didn't get hair in their food. We also may have been the only straight people here? I'm not terribly familiar with the neighborhoods in Chicago, but there were quite alot of (adorable) gay couples. Its all good. So initially, it was great... the bread was pretty good, the bartender made me a fantastic gin and tonic, etc. I had the oricchette, which was absolutely wonderful... perfect kick to the sausage and a nice sized portion as well. The pasta was nice and thick, like real pasta should be. The ravioli, although delicious, was not portioned well. Only eight raviolis come with the dish and they aren't much larger than the chef boyardee variety. So if you're coming to eat with a capital E, avoid filled pastas (which is pretty much the rule everywhere, yes?). The spaghetti was sort of boring. And I understand spaghetti can be fantastic if done well, even though it is a simple dish. This.. was not done well. Things were cooked properly, but it had the flavor of cooked celery, which is to say, not much. The duck with mushrooms and chestnuts was cooked quite well and was delicious, but the chestnuts themselves were sort of mealy and... not terribly tasty. The gnocchi was also good, from what I tried, but I'm pretty sure the oricchete was the best dish on our table. The desserts were decent but not anything to write home about. The chocolate hazelnut torte was pretty good, although it didn't warrant finishing the whole piece. And the chocolate mousse with almonds was also pretty good, as it had a wonderful creamy texture, but again, nothing outstanding. The biggest downfall was that the waitress couldn't have been any more blatant about how badly she wanted to get us out of there. I understand a ten top is a hassle, especially on an event night and in a small, intimate restaurant. But at least be cordial. I'd consider going back if I were in a group of two. And not on an event night. PS. Forgot to mention: their bathrooms are unisex and DONT HAVE LOCKS. This caused a ...""situation""... when I busted in on somebody.

I usually have weird feelings about places that are always sending out coupons  ...but I was proved wrong. After getting several in the mail, I finally decided to use the ""four course meal"" coupon.

The items we got would have normally added up to $25 more than we paid. It's a small but cozy place, a great romantic date restaurant. Service was fantastic -- prompt but not overbearing. I got the seafood risotto -- it was a huge dish of creamy rice, decorated with clams, mussels, shrimp and squid. A little too much squid, though, I could have done without half of it. After drooling over the plate at the table next to us, my bf ordered the lasagna. It was about the size of his head, and he has a big head. I tasted some and it was probably some of the best lasagna I ever had. We finished the meal with a warm bread pudding -- not the best I have ever had, but my boyfriend loved it.

To get there, you've gotta drive north forever, past weird neighborhoods that reek of potatoes and pride, past boarded up storefronts and small side-streets with slummy looking apartments and gas stations advertising 'Cheep beer and lottorey.' Once you get there, though, you know it. It's very suburban-ish. Laid back. Giant hot dog characters in the roof. It's a drive-in, which is foreign to a lot of people in this day and age. You park, you press the buzzer. A box asks you what you'd like to eat. You're at Superdawg, so naturally, you order a Superdawg. 30 minutes later, a haggard looking lady who's seen a thing or two comes to your car and hands you your food. The Superdawg comes in a collapsible box and is buried beneath a fistful of lackluster crinkle-cut fries (it's not Superdawg's fault-- crinkle-cut fries are just pretty awful by nature). The Superdawg itself, though, is delightful. It's fat and juicy, topped with mustard, neon green relish, tomato-wedge, celery salt, diced onion, and if you're feeling wild, hot peppers. It's hot and sloppy (my favorite strip club, by the way) and you'll end up spilling most of it down the front of your shirt. Note to teens: Do not go to Superdawg before prom. Anyway, you eat the 'dawg and you head back to the city. You sleep it off, like a bottle of bourbon or a prizefight you trained poorly for. You wake up and you have that weird feeling that you get after a nap, where it feels like whatever you did before the nap happened a different day. You wake up and spend the rest of your Saturday evening watching Footloose. It's just a Footlose kinda day, I guess.",4,2,2,2,0,FCcgXODBs6O7MGH3VZNyLQ

Arrived at the restaurant and was surprised by how big this place was!! The entrance looked like a tiny bar / 5-table place, yet when the host waved us out back, I was pleasantly surprised by the large dining room (x2!) It was a nice, warm evening, so I figured I'd give the outdoor patio a try. Con #1:  They only had dim lights / candles on selected tables, and for some reason, despite our early arrival hence empty seats, we were led to a 2-seat table with no candles, and not under any light.  This spelled disaster for the remaining evening.. as our server didn't even offer to light a candle, and we couldn't see what our platters looked like at all! We decided to give the Calamar a la Parilla a go, nothing spells exotic Cuban cuisine like fresh seafood!  The calamari were tasty, charcoal-grilled so you can taste hints of smokiness. The ""red pepper sauce, sautéed vegetables & queso de cabra (goat cheese)"" was fantastic, and truly complemented the dish. With such a great appetizer, I was in a happier mood. I was underwhelmed by the service though... there were less than 10 tables in the restaurant (6pm on Tues), yet our server was super slow and paid far more attention to the table next to us (who ordered a HUGE pork chop), not to mention our candle still hasn't arrived. Con #2: The outdoor patio is situated behind the Brown line track, so you'd hear occasional train pasting, creating a REALLY loud noise... not the most romantic addition to the background music... After our long wait, we finally ordered the entree: La Ropa Vieja with a side of fried yucca.  The meat was flavorful, but nothing distinctly unique and I didn't find the herbs ""Cuban"" enough....

Maybe it was an off day for me and/or the restaurant, but I didn't share quite the same feelings. It was lunch on a Monday when my friend and I arrived. Upon entering, I scanned the restaurant and found the decor to be pretty interesting and the noise level to be awkwardly quiet. There was no music playing - which is not a must for every restaurant but I honestly felt weird talking a little bit above normal conversation volume. Also, I remember the lights being turned off which I thought was strange. I know it was lunchtime and the sun was out, but that was not enough lighting for this place. That accompanied by the noise level made you feel like the restaurant was closed for the day and you were intruding. All that aside, I ordered the Chicago Crepe with Algerian lamb sausage while my friend had the Icosium Crepe with chicken. Both were flavorful, but nothing out of this world. Our meals came with a side of soup which were pretty good and we also ordered a side of seasoned potatoes which were nothing special. For dessert, we had a crepe filled with nutella, which again, was just ok. There was a lot of waiting around for having just one other table being served and the waitress was not very attentive. The water they served us was luke warm and there was no ice, which was a big no-no for me because I'm a HUGE ice eater and water not served cold just tastes plain nasty. Also, midway through our meal we found a gnat crawling in one of the crepes and another in the side dish. I don't know how or why they got in our food, but that was just not acceptable and I stopped eating. For the prices, I would expect better taste, service, and ambiance, but looking at other reviews it might have been an off day..a really off day for almost making me chew on the probably nutritious, but otherwise unwanted insects.",2,2,3,4,0,Rlg07N7Sl1qTzjc7zc6Whg

While the food is what needs to be talked about, the service was exceptional.  From walking in and being greeted, to having our coats taken, being seated, served, etc...  The service was not to the point where you felt uncomfortable with someone filling up your water every second you took a sip (I hate that!).  This was just the perfect amount of service and attention needed to make me feel like I was the most important person in the place. The oyster fan I am made it a must to start the evening off right with a dozen little fellas.  And while I am a fan of oysters I knew none of the types listed on the menu.  After describing the type I liked the waiter recommended two oysters that were great.  Also really gotta appreciate how they shave the horseradish on top of the ketchup and let you mix in at your own liking. The waiter recommended a great bottle of crisp clean Sav Blanc to go with our seafood delight.  I found the wine this to be more than above average.  A solid line up of New Zealand Sav Blancs from the Marlborough region - one of if not the best spots in the world for Sav Blancs. After the oyster feast we moved on to the lobster bisque soup.  Soup was fantastic and came with shaved carrots - I found this interesting.  I wish there were a few more snippets of lobster, but the soup was still top notch! Following the stomach warming soup we then followed that up with the wedge salad which was freakn great and unhealthy. Post salad we then got down to business with the 1.5 lbs of crab legs (the house special and a MUST), 2 Australian lobster tails, a side of creamed spinach and a side of au gratin potatoes. I must start with the crab legs as these were some of the best, if not the best, that I have ever had.  While you needed you cracker to get the crab out, you just needed it to break the joint as the back end of the legs were sliced open allowing you to easily pull out the goodness.  This crab was so soft and succulent, then dipping it in hot drawn butter was purely one of the best seafood eating experiences I have had. The lobster tails were solid, not the best I have ever had and certainly didn't taste like they should be the most expensive food item on the menu.  But once again, throw a little drawn butter on these puppies and you are good to go. The sides themselves are noteworthy.  I thought the creamed spinach could be talked about in the same breath as San Francisco's Tadich Grill.  The Au Gratin potatoes were some of the best I have ever had.  The thick layer of cheese on top assured my taste buds were having a good time. Shaw's can certainly be pricey but I found every dollar spent so well worth it.  I'm just happy I don't live in Chicago or Shaw's would be continually putting a dent in my wallet and adding some flab to my gut.",5,1,0,0,0,dKcO9OQ44RPRlkWe-vToFA

We came here on a Saturday at about 8pm with a total of four people. We were told that the wait would be an hour for a table to eat. So we decide to get beers from the bar. Fantastic selection. The only way I would ever come back here would be to drink from their impressive beer list and that would be it. We end up going upstairs to wait for a table. The upstairs has tables but they seem to be only for drinking and not eating. There's also a very very small bar up there that only sells bottled beer(no seating at the bar either). We end up standing for a good 25 minutes until a group gets up from a table and we take there seats. More than an hour rolls by. It was interesting because we had no idea how the hostess would actually find us when our table was ready...anyways. We send one of the members of our four top down stairs to ask the hostess when our table will be ready as it has been over an hour. She tells him that they are behind and that our table will be ready soon. He comes back up to tell as this and also tells us that names have been crossed off after ours...suspicious...Another 30 minutes rolls by, so we decide to all go down and stand right near the ""hostess stand."" We end up getting a table within 5 miinutes. We order the meatballs for our app which were just okay. It only comes with three and we weren't told this. I had the brisket with the mac and cheese, so did one other person in our party. My fiance had the brisket sandwich that came with fries, and the other member of our party had the mussels. Brisket wasn't anything to write home about, and I don't know what the hype is about the mac and cheese. It is flavorless and not good. We finish our meals(sort of) and leave pretty quickly.

I was shocked to see the Manhattans and other drinks going for $8. I've been curious about Makers 46 for a while but have yet to try it.

This place was packed upon our arrival, which made me feel that it must be a good place for breakfast. There were no tables available right away, but since it was just the two of us we opted for the bar. I ordered coffee, which was in front of me almost immediately after saying the words. The menu at Yolk is pretty overwhelming - crepes, waffles, pancakes, fritattas, ""scrambles"", traditional breakfasts (eggs + meat + hash browns + toast, etc.), oatmeal, omelettes, pastries, wraps, salads... anything your breakfast-loving heart desires. I ordered an egg white fritatta that included potatoes, chorizo, guacamole, and peppers in the mix. On the side came an english muffin (pancakes or toast were also options). My boyfriend got cinnamon roll french toast... two of his favorite breakfast foods combined, why not? The service was very quick, as the kitchen was ablaze with perpetual motion. My boyfriend's cinnamon roll french toast was basically a cinnamon roll, sliced horizontally into 3 disks, then put in a pan to toast on the bottom side of each. $8 + tax for a freaking cinnamon roll that was cut up and put in a pan? Rip-off. My fritatta was gigantic. For 10 freaking dollars it better have been! However, it was way, way too filling and despite ordering it with egg whites to give it a bit more of a healthy twist, it was dripping with grease. I ate less than 1/3 of it with my english muffin, but was so disgusted at this heavy meal I couldn't bear to eat any more of it. Every bite I felt like I was closer to death. There were two girls next to me who both ordered omelettes and got pancakes on the side. Just the thought of eating so much food makes me sick. The day before we went to a diner called Beef and Brandy, got coffee, OJ, pancakes, and 2 eggs with sausage, hash browns, and toast and spent $10 less than what we did at Yolk.

I just forgot why I loved food and haven't really gotten the same pleasure from finding great dinning like I used to. That changed last weekend. I knew I wanted to hit up one of the Rick Bayless hot-spots, but Topolobampo was way too expensive, Frontera Grill had a line around the corner, and my GPS sent me everywhere but to Frontera Fresco. So I wandered over to XOCO. The place itself is pretty unassuming. In all honesty, it looks like a nice chain restaurant, but just with a huge line. The ordering system is somewhat confusing, so here's the tip I couldn't find on Yelp: They'll come around asking for your party size and if it's for carry out. If you're in a small group (I was by myself) they'll skip you to this random cashier (letting you bypass the line) so you can order and sit down immediately. If you have a big group (and thus need to wait for a table) or if you're ordering to-go, you'll have to wait in that giant line. And the food. I got chips and salsa, a drink, and the Ahogada. Chips and Salsa: Meh. Sure it was decent, but (oh please don't hurt me for saying this) it's about on par with decent chains like Chipotle. Also, the amount of salsa given is pretty small. And in those stupid little bowls that are too small for any normal sized chip to fit in. On the positive side, the amount of time you'll waste trying to scope those last few drops onto your chip will make it feel like your food came relatively fast. Verdict: Unless you LOVE chips, I'd try something else Ahogada: THIS IS WHAT FOOD IS. This was messy, (I got it) spicy, and was as delicious as the Metra is inconsistent. It's basically a carnitas sandwich sitting face down in a bowl of spicy tomato broth. The broth just soaks through the bread, dissolving it in your mouth. As that hot broth dripped down my hand and the spice burned my mouth I felt the kind of pure excitement to be eating this that I wanted to stop every person that balked at the long line and shout at them, ""THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN WAITING IN LINE FOR SUBPAR CARMEL POPCORN!""

My party got there around 9ish and had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. Which was good for me because I found out they served DT( delirium tremens). God I love that stuff! Once seated, I looked over the menu and wanted so badly to try the ROTOLO DI MELANZANA but once I saw veal on the menu i shifted my focus on that dish. I ordered the VITELLO CARCIOFI which was veal medallions sautéed with artichoke hearts, mushrooms, tomatoes and onions in a white wine sauce. Obviously bread is given first which I think was the best part of my entire meal. That Focaccia bread was insanely good. I must of had 6 large pieces of this God given bread. Moving on with my meal, I went with the clam chowder which is what I always pick as a soup because im obsessed with it. Ever since going to Fisherman's Wharf in SF, I have been trying to find a place that could compare. But that's a whole other story. Calo was good but lacked the spice I was looking for. I asked for cayenne but gave me Tabasco instead. Made it a little better but not the taste I was going for. On to my entree, veal was overdone. Not crazy overdone but was probably left in the pan just a little longer than it should be. Artichoke hearts were good, sauce was ok but on the buttery side. At the end they had brought out a birthday tiramisu cake which was damn good. Thanks to the Calo and my friends for that one.

Everyone's tired of those all-you-can handle meathouses at this point, but they do it a little differently here. First, you may not even have to lay your rock out in front of your plate once you've been up to the salad bar. I'm telling you, you could go up ther e5 or 6 times and still not be satisfied. They have 4 or 5 stations of goodies you can throw on your plate. Ok, so if you decide to go the meat route, it's important you pace yourself. There are going to be times where there are 4 or 5 different meats being passed around and there's no reason to think you have to eat one before trying another. Just relax. Moreso than anything else, I recommend their rib eye, their bottom sirloin, and the seared ahi tuna. I mean, everything there is good, so it's all a matter of taste, but I thought those three were the best. They have things like BBQ chicken too, but I wasn't a huge fan. If God ever decides to bless us with consistently good weather again, they have a sweet rooftop bar that gets crowded beyond belief.

I know it seems a common refrain from me, but I really don't know how it took this long for me to end up here for dinner (have had take out on a couple of occasions). It's not like I didn't know about their beautifully awesome corkage policy ($3 per person, :)) or how great their food is. Still, it finally took a wine dinner for me to come here fully. It was just a complete litany of food. I attempted to take pictures at first, but that went out the window real fast. I had just gotten back from portland hours earlier with my voice gone and being insanely tired. Now, even though I noted that there was an insane amount of food, don't think that the duck wasn't ordered. In fact, for our group of 10, we had two go arounds on the duck. This is Sun Wah's showpiece and for great reason. It's just that good. Like, insanely good. It almost renders everything else here moot. But, it doesn't fully do that. We also had the fish fillet, fried chicken, octopus, and two tofu dishes (along with some other stuff too). The fist was amazing on it's own. It deserves it's own top place as well along with the chicken being great. I'm not normally an octopus fan, but this was also very good. I couldn't have enough of the tofu dishes as well. I have to comment about the service too. It was spot on perfect. It was always easy to get a hold of them. They were on point with giving us our next dishes and knowing when we were done. On top of all that, the bill came out (with tip included) to $27 a head. We ended up tipping on top of that because it almost seemed silly to pay just $27 a head for all of this.

Telling her that I've yet to find a place that was equivalent to the Cuban cooking in Miami, she recommended this place.  I was looking forward to going to this spot, only to be disappointed. If you are looking for a fusion of Cuban and Mexican cooking come to this place, but for authentic Cuban I suggest going elsewhere. I started off with a carife of Sangria which was watered down, and tasted more like the cheapest table wine and fruits that were thrown to call it Sangria. (Yes, I know that sangria is basically that, but trust me  I know the difference). The spinach quesadillas were quite tasty(one of the reasons why i gave this place 2 stars, instead of 1), The main entree I had was the Cuban style chicken with a side of Yuca, which is one of my favorite dishes. When they brought the food out,  seeing the beans n' rice, which I told them to take back because it was burnt. Yet the waiter told me that is how the beans n' rice is prepared--WHAATT??? The plantain, was very hard, and on the decorative side--sticking out of the burnt beans n' rice.   After my friend started to laugh hysterically, because I was acting too 'funny' and she didn't want anyone to spit on our food ,I decided to eat my food. The chicken was seasoned, but not the typical Cuban seasoning.  Again disappointed.  Then came dessert, Tres Leches that had coconut..again.WHATTT this place trying a little to be different.  Look point being is this, this place is a Mexican-Cuban infusion. If you are looking to go for your first Cuban spot, don't try here. Try Cafe Laguardia or Carnivale, for a more authentic taste of Cuban food. It is ok to be different, but there are some things that are better off left the original way, and Cuban food would definitely fall into this category.",2,0,0,0,1,WaIbupMGDBi5B3SChsUH8A

We had the pork belly with apple mostardo -- the apple mostardo was the perfect sweet/sour accompaniment to the salty, crunch pork belly. Then we tried the giant ragu in a tomato sauce with sausages -- the sausage were so tasty, though the pasta was a too al dente for my preference. Dish was good overall. Came the linguine with sea urchin and crabmeat. It tasted like the sea... it was different but delicious. (Interestingly, my friend thought it was too salty. I have an aversion to salt but didn't think it was salty at all... it had just a very strong sea-salt taste to it.) Lastly, we tried the mushroom pizza with the leeks and truffle oil. We thought we wouldn't be able to finish the pizza between the both of us but it was too easy 'cause it was sooooo good. Crust was warm, chewy and soft -- just the way I like it! For dessert, we opted for chocolate mousse and glad we did it. They sprinkled bits of coffee beans around the mousse and the crust was a wafer/hazelnut bottom, a la Ferrero Rocher. The only downside was the service we got. I think we got a new server. He took forever to come to our table when we got there. It must have been more than 5 minutes before he finally approached us and asked us if we wanted anything to drink. He didn't try to explain how best to order since the servings were small/small plates. He was also dropping utensils on the floor -- must have been nervous or something. The place was packed.

Awesome steak, great drinks, great atmosphere. The service was outstanding for how busy they were. Everything came fast and the waitress was helpful. She was not overbearing like some tend to be at fancy places, and only came to the table when she needed to.I started with the tuna tartare and sea scallops. The presentation for each of them was beautiful, and I was pleasantly surprised by the serving size of the tartare.  I had expected a small dish and it ended up being a pretty large portion. The tuna was very fresh and flavorful, and despite it being larger than I had originally anticipated, it was still a very light dish and left me wanting more.The scallops came with 3 perfectly cooked scallops in a broth with a few pieces of crostini. They were also delicious, so complaints there, but they were not the best scallops I've had either. For me, the crostini and the broth really made the dish. The flavor combinations were impeccable. For my entree I  ordered the 22oz porterhouse, rare. Not only was it one of the nicer porterhouse cuts I have encountered, but it was cooked and seasoned perfectly. They serve their steaks on 400 degree plates which I thought was a very nice touch as well. I can confidently say it was the best steak I've ever eaten.For our sides we had the lobster mashed potatoes and the sauteed spinach. It's difficult to mess up spinach so nothing mind-blowing there, but the lobster mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. Hefty chunks of lobster throughout creamy potatoes. I could have eaten a huge bowl of it for dinner and left happy.The bar area was nice-- loud and crowded, but nice. It was difficult to navigate but I suppose that happens in successful restaurants. I had a martini, and the blue-cheese stuffed olives were the best I've had. They also serve the martini with the shaker, so you get an extra half drink out of it.The wine list is strong and extensive, and the bar is stocked with just about anything you could ever want. The decor is very nice-- very fancy, so it could be somewhat imposing if you're not expecting that. Dress accordingly. My only complaint was the lighting-- it was extremely dark inside and I had a hard time reading my menu. I would have liked the lights to have been turned up just a tiny bit.

The avocado wontons--fresh avocado and cream cheese in a crispy wrapper--were more refreshing than any fried appetizer has a right to be. A banana leaf-wrapped sticky rice cake was a little bland, but the accompanying soy-based dipping sauce solved that minor problem.I fretted that a mere bowl of soup wouldn't be enough to calm my angry stomach. Thankfully, my cauldron of beef Pho, with its flavorful broth, tons of rice noodles, and big side plate-o-fixins (fresh cilantro and basil leaves, hot peppers, plum sauce, etc.), managed to both warm and fill me up. Significant Other's catfish in a clay pot was spicily sauced, perfectly cooked, and not fishy-tasting at all. We cleared our plates and felt pleasantly full.

It was a short visit, so this will be a short review.  We just wanted a little taste of XOCO as long as we were on the Rick Bayless block, having checked out and checked off the more expensive restaurants.  We shared a single churro with sides of hot chocolate sauce and Mexican vanilla soft serve.  The churro came a la carte and the sides were probably more expensive than they should have been.  No matter.  That was an awesome churro. It looked kind of pale, but one bite revealed it was fried to golden perfection, with a crunchy crust leading into chewy dough insides.  Not too sugary, but definitely sweet, it went well with the dark hot chocolate sauce, which was decidedly unsweetened.  This was lush, rich chocolate, with a slow viscosity and a thick, smooth texture.  If I were hungrier, I would have eaten it with a spoon.  The Mexican vanilla soft serve was also great, though less suited to the churros.  It had a nice creamy texture and a pure vanilla bean flavor that made it more interesting than your proverbial vanilla. Next time I'm in Chicago, I will come back to try the tortas and caldos, which looked so wickedly tempting even to our food-clogged eyes.  I gave a lot of money to Sr. Bayless on this trip, but XOCO's churro was one of the best things he fed me, at the most affordable price.",5,5,6,5,0,jGiKIJCVLZHXQDSNnSLPsw

I figured I'd be fair since I've only been here one time (& probably won't be back). I was really excited to have lunch here while we were in Wicker Park, after reading the reviews. However, our experience basically sucked, for the following reasons: 1. Our waitress, who seemed like she'd be a good one at first, was basically nonexistent throughout the rest of our stay. Two or three tables who were seated after us received their food before us, and I know for a fact it wasn't because our food was taking a long time to be cooked (see point 2 below). It was because our waitress was nowhere to be found. We asked one of the many employees who were just hanging around the front of the restaurant (see point 3 below) to check on our food, and he sort of wandered over in the direction of our waitress, who was at the bar -- I don't even think he spoke to her -- and then wandered back and sort of mumbled to us, ""Yeah, your waitress'll check on it in a minute."" Nice. Not surprisingly, she disappeared again after bringing us our food, and ultimately we had to send yet ANOTHER hanging-about-at-the-counter employee to get her, because it was taking way too long to pay -- and this time it was sort of funny, because I watched him as he went all over the restaurant looking for her, in and out of doors and all around. Took him forever to find her, WHO KNOWS what she had been doing. 2. The food may have been good, or it may have been really good, if it had not been left sitting out under the heat lamps for WAY too long. This is how I know that our slow service was the result of our waitress, not the cooks. My pizza had the hugest, grossest pool of grease that had collected in the middle (took about 5 napkins to sop it up), and my boyfriend's tuna melt was blackened on the edges, with cheese that was barely recognizable as such. Even his potato chips were hot, another sign that it had been left sitting under the heat lamp. As it was, the pizza wasn't bad -- I could tell that it may have been really good if it had been fresher -- but toward the end of it I found a long hair on one of the pieces. It could have been my own (although I doubt it, because of the way it was lying on the pizza), but it still skeeved me out too much to continue eating. 3. Seriously, what's up with the three or four employees who were constantly just hanging out at the front, leaning against the counter, reading the newspaper, whatever? Why are they here? What are they getting paid to do? Is there really absolutely no job that can be found for them to accomplish -- such as getting our food, for instance? Inefficiency really frustrates me, especially since we specifically ASKED one of them to do something for us and he blatantly did NOT. I really wanted to like this place. It's open and airy and very inviting, and I wanted to love the food. But I don't think I'll be back.",2,3,1,1,0,Z2nOMPedr7XYhgYhILJjEA

Piccolo Sogno met and even exceeded all my expectations. When I stepped onto their patio, I literally shrieked ""This is a Magical Wooded Wonderland!"" Honest to God, that was my first reaction. Their patio is breathtaking. It is filled with huge oak (I think?!) tree that are lit up and just sparkle. Many of the tables have huge umbrellas that also add to the magical feeling. The food was just as good as the atmosphere.  I went with my ""Moms Club/Sanity Club/Drunk Club""and we all tried something different, as well as all had a different salad.  I had the Panzanella salad and a margarita pizza! Deish!!  We also sampled several great white wines! We had a reservation and were seated right away. Additionally, the service was fabulous all night!

I mean, come on, I just ordered 90 dollars worth of food and want to have another glass of wine, and you are gonna give me a dirty look cuz you want the next party to be seated.

As the lovely Yelpers suggested, we dutifully ordered the bone marrow and pig ears before our bottoms even sat down. The bone marrow was stupendous. Can you imagine? Hot, roasted bones erupting with rich marrow, served with buttered bread, parsley, and sea salt. It just melted in your mouth. Like butter, only BETTER. Yes, apparently, there IS something better than butter. My mind is still blown. It was so good. In fact, it was so good, we ordered a SECOND serving. Just three little girls and yes, we had MORE marrow. That's how good it is. My personal favorite was also the pig ear. Deep fried strips of pig ear with kale, banana peppers, with creamy egg mixed in, it came in the more darling little pig dish.  I know it's just dinnerware, but it was so adorable! The pork jowl was literally fork tender. It tasted so flavorful, and I'm sure it would have been delicious if it hadn't been eclipsed by the glory of the marrow. I loved the carrot and lemon puree which added a lovely tartness to dish. The creamy pork shoulder tasted like flavorful pork roast. It was the last of all the dishes to come out, and, quite honestly, we were full by that time, so it was barely touched. The potatoes were really delectable as well.",5,2,2,2,0,boE4Ahsssqic7o5wQLI04w

Simple, clean flavors, no ""grease"" or mounds of dairy gooey enough for Cleopatra to bathe in- just the transcendent pinnacle of flavor for simple local ingredients. He cried when he ate the Margarita here. We liked it so much we brought his co-workers, then my girlfriends, and then the architecture firm (my girlfriend's) man works for... and then our families... no one has ever been disappointed. When one of the architects tried his pizza (the illustrious prosciutto) he demanded a moment of silence. All those present bowed their heads in reverence of the master craftsmanship, the awesome culinary ecstasy.... At this point, the owner must have mistaken our silent, worshipful study as sullen disappointment because he came over to introduce himself- I think there may have been handshakes, then bowing... because at that point he pulled out a bottle of Limoncello to toast and yes, it too was delicious! I am pleased someone had the ambition to actually go to Italy, to learn about every aspect of the craft, to send actual Italian Craftsmen to build out a wood-oven for an unsuccessful storefront and make miraculous cuisine! Try the luscious Buffalina pizza, and the Fidelis Red (bottle or glass- your choice) then thank me later. ASIDE: We've lived in this neighborhood for five years. For those of you unfamiliar: This used to be a blackened, bombed out HOLE where homeless would sleep beside the rotting carcasses of various creatures (rats, birds...) and masses of garbage-strewn weeds... I would consciously avoid walking past this storefront in broad daylight for fear of catching the flea-borne plague. It was THAT scary.  And it is all gone! No more lurking Thriller-zombies!

This is Chicago's jazz scene--it's where it's at, and Green Dolphin Street can kiss my balls (if I had them) because nothing outdoes the Green Mill. Negative one star for this reason which makes me and probably a lot of other Chicago locals sick. There are a TON of of jazz snobs that frequent the Green Mill and really flaunt their snobbiness. This doesn't happen every night, though. You will find them in there occasionally. But these are the REAL snobs--the kind that purposely make remarks loud enough--a little too loud--so that the rest of the audience can hear their knowledge of music theory and pentatonic scales. Then they act like the Green Mill is their go-to place and that everyone else that only stops by occasionally is a stranger. But news flash: MOST OF THESE PEOPLE AREN'T EVEN FROM CHICAGO OR THE SURROUNDING AREAS. They're from some other dump and they just moved to Chicago about 10 years ago when they got a job at Columbia teaching Advanced Dump-Taking and THEN they discovered the Green Mill. What twerps.

I read their review on Time Out Chicago and had to check it out.We ordered one of the Buddha Bowls, Marty's Mushrooms, and 10 wings. Now realize that 10 wings at Crisp is 20 wings anywhere else at half the cost! We got the wings half sassy and half BBQ by recommendation of one of the owners, Doug.  I was able to pick the veggies of my choice for the Buddha Bowl and got it with tofu. The veggies and seasoned perfectly.The chicken was OUTSTANDING. the outside was ridiculously crispy and the inside moist and juicy. They were not smothered in sauce like at Cheogajip. The sauces complimented the chicken really well.  Thinking of the chicken right now 2 days later makes my mouth water for more.  Did I mention that the chicken is made to order? HOT CHICKEN! mmmmm.The mushrooms were tasty as well. Doug let us sample 2 different sauces. My only complaint was there wasn't enough sauce for the amount of mushrooms we had.  The seating is communal...3 large tables with benches and then there are bar stools with a counter along the wall. Wet naps were supplied as were an unlimited roll of paper towels on the tabletops.  I was told that they are working on a liquor license and sidewalk seating. That would be most awesome once summer comes around. What is better than cold beer and fried chicken on a summer day??? They are BYOB so if you can't wait for their license, bring your own (no corkage fee).As for the other items on the menu,  I saw a lot of people order the whole chickens. The owners were very informative, patient and helpful to the customers ordering, like myself.I will surely be back for more.",5,0,0,0,1,WBU0yq9J8qiYQfI_fh2P1Q

My first dinner here, back in 2008, had me seated with my back to the room.  He was at a table behind and to my left explaining the dishes he'd just set down to the couple.  As with most of us Italian-types, he talks a lot with his hands.  I heard a clink and then a crash as a glass shattered against the back of my chair.  He'd accidently slapped it off the table while talking.  I whipped around and he looks at me, says ""Fuck, did I do that?  Sorry."" and goes back into the kitchen to have a guy come clean the glass and see if I was cool.  When he came out a few minutes later with our next course, he apologized again, but it was unnecessary considering how perfect an environment that makes. You'll have random, sometimes angry music.  You'll have great items (maybe including the poached quail egg raviolo with truffle butter - fuck yes!).  You'll taste some random wines (because he'll pour every bottle around every table unless you ask him not to, which would be lame of you). The price is solid at just over $100 per person.  Bring a little something as a gift for the kitchen and it'll be appreciated.  I usually bring some WI beers.  On one of our visits he did an extra course with a foam from a New Glarus Fat Squirrel.  The man has talent and a personality.  I'll take this over a Trotter dinner any time.",5,6,6,1,0,bNXpwTSavHBV9zBk2lUlGA

After living in the midwest for over three years, I have finally found a Latin American restaurant that comes close to the authentic food I grew up eating. A friend of mine and I asked someone we met at the Bucktown Art Festival where we should eat our next meal in Chicago, and she suggested Irazu.  ""Really good, quick, and authentic"" is what she said. And boy was she right. We walked into the incredibly busy restaurant on a Saturday night, starved and ready for some deliciousness. I ordered the special of tilapia tacos, which came loaded with rice, beans and plantains.  We also ordered chips and salsa, and chicken ticos.  The beans were just like my mother makes them -- cooked down for hours, and flavored with plenty of onions and salt.  My tilapia tacos were messy and simply flavored with grilled onions and cilantro.  The tilapia was fresh and cooked to perfection.  I have to say I was surprised, too, since they were so jammed with to-go orders and in-house diners.  Service was funny and friendly despite the craziness inside. The guys behind the counter let us try their special drinks on the house, which were sweet and surprisingly tasty (I'm not a sweet drink fan traditionally).  Next time, I will definitely order one.   If I lived in Chicago, Irazu would be a staple.  As it is, I will be convincing my Chicago friends that we'll need to visit this hole-in-the-wall next time we're visiting.  Everytime ""Chicago"" is mentioned in our house, ""Irazu"" shortly follows, and my husband is on the verge of making a special trip out to Chicago just to try this place.

Mentioning it to my date, he pointed out that all of the writing was in the same handwriting, from which we have reached thefairly confident conclusion Gino's had actually paid someone to come in and make it look like customers had done it.

As Crystal and I checked in, we were directed to the bar as the staff gets our table ready. We ordered two glasses of the 2004 K Vintners Viognier to start off the evening. About half way through the glass, we were informed the table is ready and offered a tour of the kitchen before sitting down. The kitchen tour wasn't too interesting, just a standard quick walk-by. The dinner menu was presented to us, one side listing the pre-fixe menu with choices and the other listing the Collection options. Unfortunately the Seafood Collection wasn't available, which was what I wanted to try, but we made do with the Market Collection for the both of us. A different approach to the wine pairing aspect, nothing listed, offered if asked and kind of go on a whim based on the $$ one wants to spend. Not exactly how I would of done if if I owned a restaurant, but that's a different topic. The Market Collection is a nine course menu as listed below, course three through seven were prepared two ways with each of us having a different preparation of the same main ingredient. *** Grand Amuse-Bouche ~Scallop Ceviche, Avocado Puree, Lime Segments ~Tuna, Marinated Trevio, Orange Italian Black Pearl Osetra Caviar, Chilled Cauliflower Creme, Lemon Confit 2002 Selbach-Oste Zetlinger Sonnenuhr Riesling Kabinett New Zealand Langoustine ~Fresh New Zealand Langoustine, Thai Chili, Lemon Zest, Watercress ~Roasted New Zealand Langoustine, Baby Carrots, Turnips, Fennel, Langoustine Jus 2003 Hirsch Gruner Veltinger Kammener Heiligenstein Duck ~Duck Bouillon, Duck Prosciutto ~Veloute of Duck, Duck Confit NV Rare Wine Company Charleston Sericial Madeira Special Reserve Nova Scotia Halibut ~Nova Scotia Halibut ""a la plancha"", Sea Urchin, Preserved Lemon, Citrus Jus ~Roasted Nova Scotia Halibut, Razor Clams Casino, Bacon, Clam & Spinache Sauce 2003 William Fevre Chablis Montmains Pasta Course ~House-made Farfalle, Chicken Wing Confit, Bayonne Ham & Foie Gras Glaze ~Spaghettini, Carbonara Sauce, Parmesan Reggiano, Raw Amish Egg NV Henri Billiot Rose Brut Prime Midwestern Beef Ribeye ~Roasted Prime Midwestern Beef Ribeye, Braised Beef Short Rib, Glazed Pearl Onions, Crispy Bacon Lardons ~Grilled Prime Midwestern Beef Rib Eye, Fondant Potatoes, Bearnaise Reduction 2003 Yann Chave Crozes-Hermitage Tete de Cuvee TRU Collection of Cow, Goat and Sheeps' Milk Cheeses Cherry Mint Soup Duet of Desserts 1999 Chateau Pajzos Tokaji Aszu 5 Puttonyos Mignardises and Lollipops *** While the food was good overall and we got to try two different preparations, not one single dish gave me the wow factor. As usual, the final meat course failed me once again, although good to see it was ribeye rather than the standard filet mignon, but that's about the only compliment I can give the course. The wine pairing choices were nice for the price they charged, but the word pairing should be crossed out as none of the wine paired well with the food. Not saying the pairing was awful, but definitely more thoughts could be put into the process. The service was attentive, prompt and precise, but WAY TOO mechanical and stuffy. Small talk with the Sommelier didn't go anywhere, seem disinterested. None of the staff at the restaurant had a smile on them except for one person. Same type of service as French Laundry, but not what I would enojy as a dining experience. TRU is not a place I would return, just from the food standpoint, French Laundry, LaToque and Cyrus all out performs TRU. I can certainly name a few other places of different type of cuisine that out shine TRU as well, not a difficult task. Perhaps I am a bit spoiled and too critical, but a restaurant of this level should still show better.",3,6,2,0,0,AkfSndWBxnTn-LpmiL8aLA

8/15/2011,dmEFPk9PLW9sIY1v6HT,4dk6ki0f4GKpgzAqdupOvw,"FAMOUS FOR: Superdawg (hot dog) (10/10) Hahahahah! I just surfed over to my Yelp profile page and it says ""Your next review awaits..."" and points to Superdawg, and I'm like...Wat? Of all the times I've been here, I never reviewed it? In disbelief, I went to my reviews and did a search for Superdawg and found that every hot dog joint I've ever reviewed...Superdawg was mentioned, and yet, I never actually reviewed the place! Whoa! THE BEST CHICAGO HOT DOG So, what's there left to say that hasn't been said yet? Your hot dog is served in a box, which reminds me of Animal Crackers for some reason. The hot dog is tucked away and the box is stuffed with crispy crinkle fries. The dog isn't a Vienna nor is it a Chicago Red Hot. It's its own thing. It's about the size of a Portillo's jumbo hot dog, but without Portillo's ""chlorine"" flavor (that everyone says I'm insane for saying). By the way, that ""chlorine"" flavor that only I seem to be able to taste is in Portillo's Jumbo hot dog only, not their regular sized one. In any case, it's your good ol' Chicago Hot Dog, with the dog, mustard, radioactive colored relish, celery salt, onions (blech! - I order without), pickle, and tomato...all on a flimsy bun. But the tomato isn't chopped red tomatoes, it's a small green pickled tomato. The reason I mention ""flimsy bun"" and also the reason why it doesn't lose points for it, is because I like the flimsy bun. Bread to me is simply the container that the hot dog rests in. It's necessary not only for that, but to help even out the intense salt in all that Superdawg, The problem is, a lot of places get it wrong, and the bun is too big or too intrusive. You get a nice hot dog flavor for awhile, and then the bun sorta takes over and cleans house. I don't like that. That's why I like Superdawg so much, because the bun does it's job (even out the intense salt) while not leaving much of a trace. The dog also is just incredible. I'm always amazed at the flavor of a Chicago Red Hot, given its size, but man, the Superdawg dog is just fabulous. The flavor is as intense as a Red Hot (even more so), and there's so much more of it! The only qualm is that sometimes, and it may actually be more of a mood thing than an actual Superdawg problem, the Superdawg can be a little too intense. Sometimes, the mustard, pickle, and pickled tomato sort of join forces, Power Rangers style, and it gets a little salty. Nothing that an ice cold Diet Coke or a few helping of fries can't fix, but if you have to do that, then what's the point? ALL IN ALL Even though it's probably the least Chicagoey of the famous Chicago Hot Dogs, this is my favorite Chicago Hot Dog!

I love the top & bottom sirloin the best, and their fried bananas are better than any other brazilian steakhouse. But it is a must to try everything, especially since it's all you can eat! If you're vegetarian, the salad bar isn't worth the price (I don't think any salad bar in the world would be. They really need to offer a discount for their vegetarian crowd sitting through a night of that much steak).

I arrived at the door on Poetry Slam ngiht with my writer professor friend from Cleveland, editor of a national magazine. Myself, a professor too and software entrepreneur, two Masters, musician, newspaper editor, author and poet -- listed in Poets&Writers Directory. So we're not slouches, and upstanding.Yet upon walking off the street out of the light into the Green Mill entrance area, we were met by a bullying bald bouncer in biker wear. When he wouldn't stop loudly accosting my unassuming friend for being too loud -- I think we said finally here to each other when we walked in -- I politely stated that he was the loud one, not us. Then he kept pressing, pushing obnoxiousness. Threatening us! We couldn't understand what was going on. Then some old lady slurping a drink at the bar chimed in, You're out of here. Leave. In retrospect, I often wonder if she was the owner, or just some slobby drunk. We left, went to Kingston Mines and then Buddy Guy's -- had a great time. Laughing about our experience at the Green Mill. Wondering if the owners knew how maniacal the door-tender is. How he chases away customers. And that witch. The image will never leave our minds. I had been to Green Mill many times, especially back in the 80s, even reading my stuff there. That's the only disappointment about being refused entrance to the Green Mill -- we wanted to read our poetry. Oh well, we thought, their loss. Not sure if or when I'll ever return there again.

For all the rave reviews this place gets, I was disappointed w what I found to be just mediocre Italian food.  The owners/chefs are from Mia Francesca group and I really wish we'd have gone there (even though I've been a dozen times) instead. The only two things that really stood out were the bruschetta and the black pepper and cheese spaghetti. I don't like mushrooms so I was hesitant about the bruschetta. But I gave it a shot anyway and I might just be a mushroom convert now. Sooo good. The Pepe e Cacio spaghetti was amazing. There was not enough of it for two people, though, as promised by our server. (Or maybe we just wanted more because it was the only main dish with any true flavor?) The salad was good, light. Had apples sliced very thin to add some much needed taste to an otherwise bland dressing. The pork belly was fine but it's pork belly. How is that just fine?? The polenta is too creamy, created a mess, and lacked any kind of flavor at all. My grandmother was from Italy do maybe my polenta expectations are too high but I was really underwhelmed by that polenta.  But the meat ragu they put on top was killer, so points for that. The risotto carbonara was, frankly, inedible. Points for presentation (they break the egg over it right at the table and mix) but wow was it wayyyy too rich and the sauce was wayyy too heavy. Had two bites and had to stop. It was also LOADED w salt so you could barely taste anything else in the dish. Dessert (a sort of cloudless chocolate cake) was fine but nothing I'd order a second time or even recommend to a chocolate lover. Points for great service, an amazing wine list and for it being fairly inexpensive for all you get. That said, $120 for mediocre food  for 2 is $100 too much.",2,0,0,0,1,IvdOI86_CSCRFpid2atnyA

Most of the menu dishes are small and probably a little over priced for the portions. The ambiance was rich and felt cozy and chic at the same time. We sat in the back where all the bottles are stacked so it feels like you're in the cellar. The service was excellent with attentive and personable waiters and busboy, which you need since the dishes come out at a good pace and the tables are only barely big enough to accomodate your wine bottle, glassware, dishes and a shared entree. However, you never feel cramped. And after asking the waiter to turn down the base on the speakers, this was a comfortable date place.  As for the food, I recommend everything we ordered except for the better than average, but nothing special, pizza with procuito di parma. The beet salad had great flavors which popped in your mouth. The Large riggatoni with sausage was cooked perfectly.  The octopus was delicous and tender however had a bit too much mayonaise sauce on top which detracted from the seafood (I'd still recommend the dish). The pork belly with apple chutney was cooked well and had the right amount of salt and sweet for me but might be a little too rich for others since it's essentially thick bacon.

We waited. The place was packed. At first we were crammed by the bar. After awhile the waiting area cleared out and we sat down there and ordered a few appetizers so at least we weren't starving.

We also had the popcorn with bacon fat and sage which was quite tasty. After we finally got seated the waitress was actually awesome.

The bread is hard and it's hard to take a bite, it's too small, and it is not very much like a classic reuben. I was so excited to try it and it was a major let down. The side salad however was absolutely fantastic. The pulled pork was insanely good and the best thing we had was the side of blue cheese potato salad. Holy deliciousness. They brew their own beer which everyone seemed to enjoy and we even saw people come into the bar and buy beer to go in sealed bottles so I guess that's an option too.

Now Calo's has been remodeled (actually it was a couple of  years ago) and the remodel is nice.  The problem is that it's just a little too generic-yuppie. Last time I was there, there was a ""light jazz"" combo (which is OK), but no one was dancing. The ""old school"" atmosphere is definitely missed (at least by this nostalgic ol' queen!).

We recommended the place to numerous friends and were looking forward to our next trip. We were extremely disappointed with our last visit.  In most restaurants-- including dives-- there are some basic elements we all have come to expect: namely, some semblance of organization. At Sun Wah, it was chaos. We showed up for our 8PM reservation and here is what we saw: hoards of confused people crowding the doorway, no apparent host or manager escorting people to tables or taking names, open tables waiting to be cleared for 10 minutes at a time, and numerous parties waiting either for their food or for their check. When we thought we found the ""host"" and inquired about our reservation, he told us to ""talk to the guy in white,"" of which there were three or four workers fitting that description scattered across the restaurant.  It turned out that the ""guy in white"" we needed to speak to was also filling in as a bus boy, kitchen manager, server, and cashier. When we finally got his attention, we realized that their reservations record and walk-in management system consisted of a checklist written on the back of a scrap of cardboard. After standing there for another 20 minutes, despite our reservation, we were finally taken to a table that had not been cleared or cleaned; we were still grateful given the 30 people still standing by the doorway.Things did not improve from here. After 20 minutes of sitting unattended, we flagged down three people and finally had a server bring us water and uncork our wine. We again tried to make it clear that we had called in advance for the duck, and the waitress seemed boggled. Around 8:55PM, nearly an hour after our reservation, our ""man in white"" came by to assure us that we were ""second in line for duck."" When we asked what that meant, he became  hostile and defensive, telling us that there were 8 parties behind us and that we should be grateful that we were getting duck-- or his generous update-- at all. Five minutes later, we flagged down a woman we knew from our previous visit to be an owner.  Our intent was to ask how long it would be until we would get our food. She clarified that ""second in line"" meant 25-30 minutes. Her tone was rude and defensive. She made a big fuss about how ""everybody in the restaurant wants duck tonight"" and ""we don't have enough people to cut it."" Sorry, but you're surprised everyone wants duck? That's the sole reason anybody comes here. Incredible nerve.We left at 9:15PM, cutting our losses, and went across the street to Tank Noodles for a prompt, wonderful dinner.  Unless you have three hours to kill and endless patience, don't go to Sun Wah.",1,0,0,0,1,KomhK0JD5cleEW55YTw7MQ

My aunt and uncle were in town, and my parents came with us too, so we had 6 adults and a baby with a foldable stroller with a removable carseat. The large round table in the main area was available, but the host told us that there wasn't room for a stroller near that table, so he seated us in the back room with another large (loud) party with two newborn crying babies. The room was so dark that we couldn't see each other or our food even though it was the middle of the day, and our baby seemed frightened. My aunt has a hearing problem, and we were seated right next to a speaker blasting loud hip hop, so no one could talk. The service was oddly slow, and the food wasn't as good as we remembered - my mother, aunt and I all ordered the Southwestern cobb salad, which was incredibly salty, and my husband's veggie burger was bland and undercooked.If they're going to ghettoize large parties with strollers, they should at least fix up the back room so it's as nice as the other rooms (regular lighting? softer music?). Lincoln Square is a neighborhood with a lot of babies, so it doesn't seem smart to alienate their parents by seating them in the punishment corner.

He asks the audience to interact and was so excited to see him!Problem: �A man who claimed to be the son's owner was verbally abusive and cursed myself and �a group of females, telling us individually to �Shut the f*** up. Mind you, if he thought we were loud he could say, Hey, please stop speaking until the set's over  �and we would have been like, awkward, but ok. Instead, he stood an inch from my face and stated to shut the xxxx up. We were speaking in a whisper - as did everyone else in venue - �about how �freaking amazing Chuchito was when he began his rant. When I asked if were not allowed to whisper he proceeded to state (after again saying Shut the f*** up) that he was the owner and was going to �kick us out  (Explictives not written in �this review because I think anyone who curses out other human beings in a threatening tone must have a �limited vocabulary and low intellectual ability). How hard is it to say, Hey, I'm the owner's son and at this venue no one talks during the show (which is crazy if that is how it is!). Please be quiet. But did he, nope.Then he stated he wasn't the owner, but his dad was a part owner. �I told him there was no reason to use curse words towards us. I stated there was no need to curse at me and threaten me. �His response was basically he could do whatever he wanted as he was the son's owner. His response was also filled with expletives.Here's the thing, being a professional and adult, I was and still am really shocked that �some man curses out patrons instead of being an adult. If this is a strict no talking zone, that is fine, let me know in an adult manner. Also, I will never go to a show at this place as that is my impression. It should also be explicitly �stated that whispering is not ok. �I was extremely disappointed that someone could taint such a beautiful and positive show, particularly as I nor my friends talked louder than a whisper. Other patrons �around us were also talking quietly, which I find even more disturbing about this little man. Should you go, please watch out for a little 5 foot 5 man who claims to be a relative of an owner of the club. There is something wrong with any person who feels he has the right to threaten and curse out anyone and then believe that his status (actually his daddy's status, he is not an owner) �makes it all ok. I have never been so blatantly disrespected and do not believe in anyway was this ok or justified.The bartenders, cocktail waitress and doormen were all very respectful. However, if I could, I would give no stars if possible for this little man tainting my experience of �Chuchito live.",1,0,0,0,1,t3pYu8eidmb2ZmexHRHT_Q

I have been a huge fan of Top Chef since the first season and this year's Top Chef Masters spin-off really had me captivated. So it was required that I had to plan a trip to Frontera Grill, the workplace of Top Chef Master champion, Rick Bayless. I had high hopes for trying some amazing Mexican cuisine from the master of Mexican food. This place was packed for lunch. It would have been very difficult to get a table, but luckily I came solo so I was quickly seated at the bar near the kitchen. I knew I had to try a mole dish, but I had a hard time deciding on what to get as an appetizer. It's a lot of food for one person, but hey, I'm not in Chicago very often. The waitress suggested the gorditas and I was set. The Gorditas de Borrego came with three generous sized corn masa cakes stuffed with slow-cooked lamb ""chicarron prensado,"" (which is I guess the Mexican version of bacon) and topped off with avocado and salsa. The corn masa cakes were crispy, but also light and airy. A great start to the meal and each bite had me wanting more. I knew I had to pace myself if I wanted to eat later on, but they were too delicious and fresh to save and pack up. I ended up eating all three. My entree was the Enchiladas de Mole Poblano. The star of the dish was of course the delicious and complex mole sauce drenching the chicken enchiladas. The taste was indescribable, but I will try. Each bite left you with an initial burst of flavor, sweet, bitter, savory, and then it slowly faded to a pleasant spiciness. The mole had so many flavors and layers, but they all came together to make the dish work. The chicken was tender and the tortillas were also good, but they took a backseat to the mole. I've never tasted anything so deliciously complex before. I live in San Diego so I am surrounded by Mexican cuisine. If this was Mexican food, I am not sure what I've been eating for the past seven years. Unfortunately, I didn't see the Master Chef while I was eating, but I later saw him when I walked over to Xoco to check it out. I couldn't miss an opportunity to meet him so when he went back to Frontera, I asked the hostess if I could meet him for a picture. I could see he was very busy trying to manage both restaurants, but he was still nice enough to meet me in the kitchen for a quick photo op. I highly recommend a detour to this restaurant if you are ever in Chicago. It will be worth the wait to try a piece of true México.",5,2,2,0,0,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w

If you are expecting more traditional French crepes (the usual complete"" or stuffed crepes with bechamel sauce and wine), this place is not for you.  Now if you are willing to experience the crepe concept with more North African flavors and ingredients, you came to the right place,  you won't be disappointed and I guarantee you'll be back. The experience starts upon entering: nice decoration with shiny copper on the walls, a lot of mirrors, smell of mint, friendly smiles from the staff, all reminescent of Algiers or maybe Marakkesh.  Right there you are already transposed to a different part of the world. Now the food and drinks, well I'm a sucker for mint tea and this one is really good so I would start there. The crepes, well all great with interesting and well balanced flavor combinations. The salty ones are served with a rather big cup of soup. I had the vegetables puree and  it felt freshly made. For the crepes, I would start with the Icosium or the Marrakesh which again combine typical North African ingredients like raisins, pine nuts, tapenades and result in well balanced great tasting crepes.  If you feel adventurous, add a serving of Merguez to your crepes (spicy lamb sausage), they are authentic and will come with the usual Harissa (spicy paste) on the side for an even more authentic experience. Hope you save space for dessert because the dessert crepes are certainly worth indulging.  Here you can go the traditional French way: nutella/banana, Belgian chocolate/banana.... or again if you feel like trying something more exciting, go for the ones with more North African ingredients in which case the Icosium dessert crepe is a good place to start: fruit compote counterbalanced with rose petal water, simple yet out of this world.

This was one of those meals that I will remember for the rest of my life. My best friend and I decided that while our birthdays are a half a year apart, we would take each other to Frontera to celebrate nonetheless. I am SOOOOOO glad that we did. We each started with margaritas. I had the Gold and my friend had the Blue. Now, I love me some tequila, but man was that delicious! We started with the Ceviche trio...OH MY GOD. The tuna was delicious, the calamari/shrimp refreshing, and the fish INCREDIBLE. Seriously, don't miss the ceviche if you come here. WOW. And, the perfect size for sharing; generous but not over done. I had the swordfish with the green mole. Fantastic. It was served with zuccini and sweet potatoes, and cooked to perfection. My friend got the pork with spaghetti squash, another shining star of this delightful evening. For dessert, he got the ice cream with caramel and I had the duo of flan. YUM YUM YUM. I really loved both of these. The caramel sauce tasted like it had chai in it...which was both unexpected and delightful. We also had coffee with our dessert, which was seriously one of the best coffees I've had in a long long time. The service was stellar, and the ambiance comfortable and relaxed while also being eclectic. I will be back as often as possible. Love, Suzanne",5,2,1,1,0,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w

I've eaten here several times, and it never fails to disappoint. This is yet another Jerry Kleiner theme restaurant, and I must say my favorite. From the moment you walk in, it's a feast for the eyes with vibrant colors. In fact it's other worldly. The décor is obviously Cirque du Soleil inspired which puts a surreal vibe in the air. Seeing as this restaurant offers pan-Latin cuisine (or as our waiter called it, ""Latin Soul Food"" cuisine), I don't quite get the connection to the décor...but it's such a delight to the senses that I won't ask questions. The bar, which I've frequented in the past, also serves dinner and has a festive atmosphere from another world, but the dining room is ""the"" place to be. We started off with their Mojitos, which our waiter bragged are known as the best in town and are made perfect down to a science. You know what? He was right. It was the best in town I've tasted, with just the slightest hint of sweetness (one of my pet peeves is a mojito that tastes like someone dumped a ton of sugar into it). They're addictive. On to our appetizer; I've always been impressed that Carnivale offers five different kinds of Ceviches. I've tried one or two here or there, but was happy that my friend agreed on sharing a ""tasting"" of all five, which were served with Chicago flatbread (make sure to ask for extra flatbread, they are generous about that).  All were incredible, my favorite being the ""Camarones"", a spicy shrimp ceviche. On the waiter's favorite recommendation, I tried the ""Churrasco"" as my entree, which he described as Nicaraguan style beef tenderloin. It was served on top of this incredible goat cheese puree, with some type of pureed arugula sauce drizzled on top (I normally hate arugula, but in this instance it was the perfect condiment).  I purposely ate my entrée in slow motion so that it would never end. ""I Love Food"" Yelper Tiffany did the same. All in all yet another great experience here.

We went with an order of cashew chicken, Pad Thai and a spicy tuna roll. We were quoted a 15-minute wait and when we arrived, our food was professionally packaged (who likes drippy sauces all over your order?). And, some extra fortune cookies were doled out upon request, with a smile. So, the food - simply wonderful! I'd rate the Pad Thai as an A-, the cashew chicken as a B and the spicy tuna roll as a B+. Solid eatin' all around, and for super reasonable prices. $5 for a fresh spicy tuna roll? I believe they're more expensive (and much less edible) at Jewel.

Five of us came in on Friday and we waited for the rest of our party to show up so those of us that were there went to the bar.

Our server, Shawn was awesome, quick with the chips and pickles and refills as we needed it. When we told him that we were thinking of sharing four entrees between the five of us. He not only let us know that it would be enough but he suggested that we add the mac and cheese as an extra side. The pulled pork was tasty, a lot like South Carolina style hash and which went well with the mustard sauce. The St. Louis Ribs were a good choice too with a slight sweetness to it and the vinegar sauce, which was something that was hard to find was also tasty. The chicken, well it was chicken and the spicy sauce made it better. I had such high hopes for the Kobe brisket, thinking that Kobe beef plus BBQ would be terrific but I found it terrible: rubbery, over done and just about inedible. I gave my share of it to the others and took an extra helping of ribs. Side wise I thought the mac and cheese was just okay while the 2 cornbreads were indistinguishable from each other. The slaw was pretty good and the dusted fries were also pretty tasty.

The live band began playing around 8 o'clock and we were luck enough to have found a seat. (We could've sat closer to the stage, but we wanted to sit together). The music was great and only got better as the night progressed (whether that was from the alcohol or the band playing better, I can't tell you, although I'm pretty certain the band just got better and better). Everyone there was into the music and often times, I felt the urge to get up myself and just groove along, although I didn't, which I regret. But I digress. The drinks were well made, at least in my opinion. I haven't been able to try many cocktails other places, since this was my first bar I could legally get into. But I thoroughly enjoyed it. Surprisingly, the drinks came out rather quickly despite the large crowd inside, and my friends and I definitely appreciated that.

From the moment I called to see if we needed a reservation until we left with full tummies I felt like the people here actually enjoyed working there and were happy to serve us. We did not have reservations and there were no seats at the bar so we were led to a standing table to enjoy wine and starters, if we ordered them. Almost finished with our wine we had decided to leave when a hostess informed us that we could be seated at a communal table. Yay! We took it. The seating was not as strange as it sounds. I expect to see more of this as our city becomes more and more crowded. If you call and reserve you could be seated in a really cool booth that is designed to make you feel like livestock in a pen. The plates are shared, we had the Bollito misto (sausage, smoked ham and pork shoulder) and Cauliflower gratin. You know the food is good when Dora and I are a table and we're both quiet.

Food servers and cashiers: you don't need to fake like you've been dying to see me since I last came in a month ago, but at least say something to me. Or grunt in my direction. 2. The assembly line operation that Sultan's has become is indeed a marvel of 20th Century industrial science, but just as with Ford, more ends up being less. The quality of the now mass-produced food has declined enough that I can no longer in complete honestly tell people who haven't yet been here that it offers the best falafel ever. Still in the top ten, though. My humble advice is to avoid the most tragic victim of this Taylorization of Middle Eastern delights: the legendary falafel sandwich itself. More over-looked items like the spinach pie and the curry basmati rice are still given enough TLC to ignite anyone's palate. 3.

While the restaurant provides a novel approach, full of science-meets-cooking gastronomy, the distinct flavors have the substance to ensure that the experience is not gimmicky. Alinea has a vast wine list that is filled with treasures that are surprisingly (relatively!) reasonably priced at a fraction of the markup of many high end restaurants. Sadly, though, unless you're dining with a big party, it's pretty impracticable to limit yourself to a single full bottle for a meal that covers the entire spectrum of familiar flavors (plus some that are totally new to even well experienced first-timers.) We instead opted for the wine pairings which included about 12 half-glasses for the Tour menu and incorporated a few familiar and many obscure varietals.

Another not-so-fine-moment of pure gluttony at Hopleaf: the mussels.  I went there (again, pre-Check, Please!) with three other guys.  We ordered the mussels for two.  The waitress erroneously thought we needed two buckets.  No.  We needed four.  And sausage.  And cheese.  And lots of beer.  Just when I thought the evening couldn't get any more disgusting, two of my party DRANK the mussel bucket juice.  I was shocked and sickened into sobriety.  Surprisingly, one of them threw up.

I took a group to Gilt Bar for a business dinner. Made reservations for 7:00, arrived at 6:30 and were made to wait for half an hr ... Even though there were numerous empty tables. Once the hostess deemed us near-worthy, she seated us at a table that had been empty since we arrived. The table was small, next to the front door, and in a very busy spot so I politely asked for a different table (there were at least 6 - 7 empty in immediate view) �She snapped that the other table was being saved in case a party of 5 came in (there were only 4 of us). I pressed the issue so she turned to my business associates, snatched the menus out of their hands, tossed them onto the other table and then turned to me and snapped, I hope you're happy. Answer: no, I'm not happy but I'm entertaining clients so I'm not going to make the scene that I'm dying to make. After the low-class treatment at the beginning it was hard to know if the rest of the meal was tarnished by the nastiness of the hostess, or if it was truly bad.

8/20/2012,htt3dQnR0z55un5gOOfCPw,tFUWZZOgZMK9ZrpyppfOLg,"As part of my birthday celebration, my wife and I went to Carnivale this past Friday night. It was our first time eating here and we walked away with a high opinion and plans to revisit in the future. For starters, the staff and waiters were very nice and helpful. We were seated within minutes upon check-in (we had 7:30PM reservations for 2) and were given a table on the second floor overlooking the main dining area. The space is beautiful. Formerly a warehouse, the place has been renovated with outdoor seating, a bar area and an adjoining main dining room with vaulted ceilings, brightly colored lamps, a huge glass mosaic and cool decorations.The atmosphere was fun and vibrant. Music was playing in the background during our meal but we didn't have any trouble hearing one another. In fact, it was just loud enough to drown out your neighbors and provide a little bit of conversational privacy.We had heard positiive reviews about their mixed drinks so my wife ordered the Coconut Mojito and I ordered the Mojito Millonario. Both were good; however, I was partial to my libation. It was a few dollars more than the regular Mojito but the 12 year estate rum they used was absolutely delicious and worth the extra expense. In addition to the rum upgrade, in the Millinario they add cava (spanish sparkling wine) and forego simple syrup, which is used in the regular mojito. This made for better flavor and kick in my opinion. The food we ordered really hit the spot as well and was prepared perfectly. To start, we had the Arepas and the Ropa Vieja. Both had great flavor. The pork belly and corn cheese cakes in the former were a nice pairing. If I had to choose between the two though I would go with the Ropa Vieja. The braised beef and spicy mayo together with the other ingredients made for an incredibly tasty combination. Plus, in the RV they give you 4 little portions per plate compared to 3 on the Arepas dish. Regardless, you won't go wrong with either.For entrees we chose the Churrasco and the Bistek Palomilla. There was no clear cut winner in my mind because both dishes had unique and satisfying flavor profiles. The meat for both was cooked just right; tender but not bloody and easy to cut. My wife made the comment that the Churrasco tasted more latin american'esque while the Bistek Palomilla was more amorphous, although still excellent. She may have had a point. Regardless, the roasted mushrooms, radish salad and brisket mofongo disappeared quickly from my plate. The sweet potato puree and corn on her dish did compliment each other and the beef tenderloin very well.Since it was my birthday they brought us a free dessert, flan with bits of caramel popcorn on the plate. I didn't even see that option on the menu but it hit the spot. Definitely not the best I've ever had but since it was free I wasn't complaining. Had they not surprised us with this I would have ordered the Banana Cream Pie, which sounded awesome. Next time!",4,0,0,0,1,sfWMOqUEp8S2adDeJp7Kzg

I believe a little drool may have even sipped out when I was looking at the wings...gulp. Anyway, we went, we saw and boy did we conquer!   The place is tiny and let me tell you that on a Friday night at 8:15pm it was pretty packed. They have 2 ""bar like"" seating areas and the rest are family style tables, so there really is no privacy for intimate conversations...aka, not good for first dates.   I have to say that we (the fiance and I) didn't even talk much since we were concentrating on eating almost the whole time.

Also, the greens were nothing spectacular: generic salad mix.2. The cheese fondue is like Gruyere nacho cheese. By the time we were finished it was congealing on the sides of the pot. It is awfully thick, and seems as though it must have been prepared hours earlier and sat in a pot waiting. The cheese, if it truly is Gruyere, is obviously low quality. By the end I was eating plain pretzel bread (pretty good) to try to get the taste out of my mouth. 3. Chocolate was fine. The pound cake was pretty burnt.We skipped any sort of meat, noting that they advertised grain-fed USDA Choice beef, as if that were something to be proud of. In an age when many restaurants are offering grass-fed options beef (and even charging extra for it), bragging about grain-fed seems very dated. For over $40/person and not huge serving sizes of meat, I would think they wouldn't brag unless it were USDA Prime. I suppose it wouldn't really bother me if they had just said beef tenderloin without all of the extra features.Everything is just behind the times and seems careless.

The bar was set pretty high considering the pricing and reputation but ultimately everything seemed just pretty good with a couple of bad parts.  The intention for me and my date was to each get the tasting menu. Our server made it seem like if we didn't upgrade to the ""experience"" menu then we were missing out and would be disappointed.... kind of made me feel like I was buying a car. We agreed to add on the octopus to the tasting menu. For the rest of the meal she was nice and attentive though. I won't go over each dish but I will say that the amuse bouches were the better parts of the whole thing. The caviar amuse with garden sorrel and panna cotta was very tasty. I also enjoyed the caesar deconstruction with the brioche twinkie. When the onion soup came out I was excited. There was whipped marrow in the bowl with gruyere and then a beaker of broth to the side for us to pour into the ingredients - great presentation but unfortunately the flavor just wasn't there. The broth was very bland and the ingredients were not potent enough to make up for it. I didn't have the nerve to ask for a salt shaker but that's what I was thinking as I struggled through it. Neither of us ended up finishing. Skate was decent, chicken was pretty good, and the chocolate ganache dessert was enjoyable. I wil have to say I've had much more flavorful/satisfying, relatively bigger portioned, small plate multi-course experiences at a more reasonable price. I just felt like I would have been happier purchasing a small TV for my kitchen which I could have easily covered with the amount I paid when the check came.

So, one evening, after picking me up Tony told me he was going to take me to Fritz pastry but by the time we got there they were closing. He turned and said don't worry, there's another place called Alliance Bakery that sold French macarons as well. So Tony, tamia and I headed there instead. Open for business, Alliance had only one worker that evening. Walking in, you can tell it's a cozy little bakery. I was amazed of all the beautiful cakes on display filled with intricate designs. Anyway, the server asked us if we had any idea what to order, since there was another patron in the store we told him to serve her first. When she left we were still clueless on what to order. Tamia decided on a simple chocolate cupcake, which she had devoured in the car. She loved that it was moist and not overwhelmingly chocolaty. I order two almond croissants for my sister and she said it was AMAZING! Tony ordered practically all their macarons (pistachio, chocolate, lemon, rose with rose cream, vanilla, rose with chocolate). The pistachio macarons were awesome. Light, crisp and moist, none of the flavors overpower the other. The rose was refreshing, very airy and definitely taste like rose. The lemon was my favorite; it reminded me of biting into a lemon meringue pie. The chocolate and vanilla tasted stale and old. That was a huge bummer. Overall, Alliance is a nice hidden place and has a great amount of sweets on display. I know that their macarons flavors are seasonal so you just have to wing it for that particular day and hope it's as great as it looks. I need to come back for their almond croissants and hopefully I can pick up some more macarons.

I think the Chicago Diner is definitely a contender with it's Vegan exclusive menu choices.  My first time here, I was very skeptical because I'd never been to a vegan restaurant before but one bite of the 'pot stickers' with their accompanying tangy soy sauce and I was hooked!  I had three different entrees and be warned that EVERYTHING tastes different but in a creative way.   The service is also excellent, every server is jovial and polite and don't even get me started on the Shakes...  I would have NEVER thought a vegan shake would taste better than one from Oberwise but I was way wrong and best of all, I don't spend an hour with stomach cramps after I have one of Chicago diner's shakes. My only quibble is the location,  where the limited parking is off an alley way where your car might get dinged.  Also, If you're having dinner, get here before 5pm, because the dining space is small and get's cramped when busy.   I'm looking forward to trying their brunch at some point, I've heard their breakfast food is good!",5,0,0,0,0,o54U2VkQama8FI30qDkWvw

That's not to say that every dish is superb, but most of the ones I've tried have been very good. Here's a breakdown of my most recent meal here. There were four of us, and we opted to order a variety of dishes to share (this is what the waitress recommended). For starters, we got cheese and fig jam on toast, which was excellent. We also ordered the marinated beet salad, which I have to say was a huge disappointment. I love beets, but the marinade that was used in this salad completely overpowered any beet flavor. In fact, the dish tasted more like perfume or soap than food. It was quite bizarre. For the main course, we ordered the pork belly, truffle pasta, and a short rib pasta dish. Of the three, my favorite was the truffle pasta, which I easily could have polished off by myself. The other pasta dish was also good, but I'm not a big beef eater. The pork belly was quite tasty. We split two desserts: an apple cake and carrot cake, both of which were equally delicious. The service was good overall, but I did feel like the waitress was rushing us a bit at times. She was also very particular about how things were arranged on our table. For example, there was a pile of appetizer plates in the middle of the table and she found it imperative to distribute the plates to us as we were still perusing the menu. It seemed a bit anal considering that we weren't even eating anything yet. Those are really small issues, though. Overall, the food here is really good and the atmosphere is nice. I definitely plan to return.",4,3,2,1,0,sDYjKyI_67eUhFAqVneYjA

We made reservations for 7:30PM and arrived at the parking lot adjacent to the restaurant which was nice as they validate and it only cost $12 which is far better then the $32 it would have cost had they not. Upon entering we were promptly greeted by the host and seated within minutes. After sitting the waiter Antonio showed up shortly after and we were on our way. Pulled out my Daughter and Girlfriends chair which they blushed at and then we were off to the salad bar. I found the salad bar better then the one in Schaumburg but the Girlfriend says it is not... The Waiter was fantastic and attentive and my Daughter was over whelmed with joy and had the time of her life everytime she flipped over her little Meat Indicator and then staff rushed her asking her if she wanted to try whatever meat they were serving at the time... It almost became a game to her... At the end of the meal the waiter served us dessert and brought the bill being on ball the entire time... He even took my ticket up to be validated... My only complaint was my Daughters $3.50 sprite with no refill but that is how this place is so you deal with it...,5,0,0,0,1,3Mx2PM7v8qjqhgF3cDXxbQ

The guac and the ceviche were very good, but the quesadillas were my favorite and I""ll definitely be ordering those again during my next visit to Frontera!

The Publican looks pretty cool.  The space is voluminous and open, with communal dining and a dine-at bar.  Dishes are made to share, and the wine list is affordable (I counted roundly four bottles for less than $30. I need to mention that complimentary sparkling water is offered with is a huge deal for me.  Still is available as well. **THE SERVICE** - A bit scripted, I will agree, but the menu is elaborate and there is alot to learn.  The place is new.  Both the servers and hosts were very friendly and the place seemed customer-centric, unlike Avec which often throws off the take-it-or-leave-it vibe.  The staff was happy to call a cab for me and answer all of my questions.  As a caveat I was there on Monday and I was maybe one of 25 in the restaurant. **THE FOOD** - Pork centric, which plays into the whole Fulton Street hog Mecca thing.  Impressive seafood selection - 9 dishes plus 6 types of oysters. I had the smoked fish and the quercia rossa aged ham, with a side of wood roasted sunchokes with chanterelle mushrooms.  The smoked fish (smoked eel, mackerel, and trout) dish was very rich and came with a piece of bread smothered in fromage blanc, which was secretly glutinous but delicious.  The ham portion was generous - too much for one person after the fish - and came with bread and goat butter (interesting).  The sunchokes added the one-two Avec slathered-in-butter punch, culminating in me needing a doggie bag.  I think the sunchokes were my favorite of all three. **THE BOOZE** - I had a martini made with Juniper gin.  It was $9, which is more than reasonable for good place.  As mentioned before they offer several affordable bottles of wine and a great beer list but to be honest don't rush here for the beer list.  It's more interesting than about 80% of the places out there but not the end-all-be-all in beer joints.  Avec has almost an equally interesting beer selection. **THE PRICE** - Certainly put a hurt on for a meal for one.  I could have easily shared all of my dishes and shared a $24 bottle of wine, so come here with a group. The only reason I didn't give the place 5 stars is the price, plus the place isn't breaking new ground in terms of food.  It's basically Avec v2.0 but a little more expensive.  But, when you have a good formula go with it.

Alliance, and especially Michael Nitschky, the retail manager, was the least accessible and professional of them all. To get just a *response* - what ensued: I stopped in, told to email; emailed, never got a response; stopped in again a few days later, was told Michael would get the letters/brochures I printed out by 9AM; received no call, even though they were aware that the sale was happening in the afternoon; finally called again past 11AM when I received no word; he answered the phone with ""this is Michael"" and I had to brief him about everything as if he hadn't really gotten any messages. It's not a big deal if you can't help -- the least you can do is respond when the decision is so clear-cut on your end and keep us from waiting around with our hopes up.

When I talked to my waitress this past Friday at lunch about gluten she didn't seem to know what I was talking about - so I went the safe route and ordered a basic salad. The salad arrived with a piece of bread on it - so I explained that I can not have wheat (at this point it wasn't worth describing what gluten is) and asked to have another salad made. In half an hours time I found I had been glutened! I'm still sick (usually getting sick from gluten takes about two weeks to get over). I called the restaurant to let them know what had happened. A gentleman named Chris implied that I had called to try to get a free meal as well as implying that Meli's didn't get me sick. I told him that I had gotten sick and even a free meal wouldn't be enough to get me to come back to his restaurant.

6/5/2009,5ivR7hidOpUd760J0sztmg,Q_fF04Uu5eAo0D-b3FqaYQ,"I was really excited to eat at Piccolo Sogno because I heard great reviews about it and always pass it by with curiosity. I finally had a chance to dine there a few weeks ago and my review is very mixed. Cons: I made reservations through American Express for 7:30pm on a Thursday evening. After everyone in my party arrived, we approached the hostess and she replied we needed to wait 10 minutes. We proceeded to chat outside, noticed a lot of nice cars and sugar daddies, then went back inside after 15 mins to follow up on our reservation. The hostess then said another 10 min. We played this 10 minutes after 10 minutes game one more time and finally I asked the hostess what the hold up was. It was getting late, waaay past our reservation time and we've been more than patient. The hostess told us they had an unexpected number of walk-ins and the kitchen was overwhelmed, as a result, out of consideration for my party of 3, she would rather have us wait than to sit at a table to wait for food to come out. I challenged her and asked what's the purpose of reservations if they don't honor it and instead seat all of their walk-ins? I was also surprised and didn't believe that a restaurant such as Piccolo Sogno would have an ""overwhelmed"" kitchen when it was obviously not a full house and I assume the chef is not a newbie and must have prior experience preparing for a full restaurant. The hostess apologized and told us she would speak with the manager. After being seated, our waiter was very friendly but we could tell he was overworked and a bit frustrated. Another point deduction because although I don't expect all waiters to carry a shining smile when the restaurant is crazy, it's never a good thing when your patrons can tell the restaurant is in chaos. We also had to flag down a confused bus boy many times because our waiter was nowhere to be found. Pros: Excellent food. Not your typical huge family style Italian dinner. We could tell everything was made with quality, not quantity. We started out with the fried calamari, very fresh and lightly battered, not the type of oil you recycle again and again. My two girlfriends ordered pasta dishes: Four Cheese Ravioli and Potato and black truffle stuffed pasta whereas I ordered the special of the day, a mixed vegetables dish, perfectly grilled and fresh. The ravioli was boiled to perfection the sauce did not overwhelm the cheese, it was a perfect pair. As for the truffle pasta, you could not go wrong with truffle! We devoured our food and didn't have any leftovers. The decor was very nice too. Nothing grand, just very simple and tasteful. We didn't have a chance to sit outside but from afar it looked trendy and refreshing. It turned out the hostess did speak with the manager because we received free dessert, which was perfect as well...right amount of sweetness and size. Overall, if it wasn't for the horrible reservation organizing skills which I'm not sure who to place the blame on, dinner was a pleasant experience. Parking was fairly easy too with plenty of street non-metered parking available, hard to come by in Chicago!",3,0,0,0,0,JMa9cTNQA5mm4GbR2W8Oiw

Each time I have eaten here, it has been a joy.  Collectively, we've probably tried close to a dozen different menu items at this point - and while some really stand out more than others - we have NEVER been disappointed.  The menu is traditional yet innovative - a breath of fresh air from the run of the mill pho joints around town.  The raw ingredients are quality, the preparation clean and tasty.  The BYOB policy with no corkage fee makes Simply It a fantastic value too, especially since the menu is so reasonably priced as it is.   The atmosphere and crowd are vibrant, making this place feel festive on weeknights as much as on weekends. The staff has always been very kind and helpful.  One server in particular is dynamite.  She is so informative about the menu items and each particular dish; how each is best eaten, what accompanies it best.... You could truly see her pride in her heritage, and cuisine, and it's just contagious. Each recommendation was spot on. All the elements are there: the food, the value, the atmosphere, the service, the location - but what I like perhaps most about Simply It, are the little touches and care shown by the owner/manager.  I don't know his name, but he is there each and every time I've gone - going out of his way to please his customers.  He is probably the hardest working man I've seen, and will bus tables himself just so a couple won't have to wait one minute more than they have to for a table.  He smiles genuinely, and if he's out front, makes sure to shake your hand and thank you profusely upon leaving. On a busy night with a wait, he provides complimentary spring rolls and water - or whatever else you'd like to drink - and can't be more accommodating or apologetic for the fact that ""you had to wait so long to be seated.""   I tell you, I'd love this place on its own, but the owner and staff add the personal touch and warmth that elevates this restaurant to a whole other level.  As a customer, you feel like you matter and are never taken for granted.  That's how it should be, how it used to be.  How often do we, as patrons, forget that and accept less?",5,3,1,0,0,N7juvW8YoFIj7sEBzVF8GQ

It was pretty empty around 12:30 but had a nice sized crowd by the time we left around 1:45. A lot of regulars which is always a sign of either good food or bargain prices. Both of which I am a fan of! The waiter didn't miss a beat. He had everything ready to go for us knowing we were in a bit of a time crunch. We split the crab and avocado salad which was an interesting combination I had never had before. Not bad! Not bad, at all. They didn't skimp on the minestrone. It was very thick (it probably didn't help that I added a couple spoonfuls of Parmesan) & I'm not gonna lie, I was sad to see it go but had to save room for the entree!

We almost wound up at Hamburger Mary's, which I'd already been to and liked, but wasn't thrilled with going to again. Then I read on a sign across the street ""Italian AND American food."" I pointed this out because I could very well have had some Italian and those who didn't want that could order another dish on the menu, thanks to their brilliance in offering ""American"" along with Italian. From the moment we stepped in, it was warm, welcoming and very inviting. We sat at a nice round table that was comfortable and made it possible for everyone to be engaged. The menu selections were great -- from classic Italian dishes to specials. I chose the baby back rib special -- and for only $12.95 it was truly awesome. Started with soup or salad; could have pasta or baked potato. The pasta I ordered with meat sauce was extraordinary - full of flavor! The ribs were succulent and tender. The portions were so large I could easily get 2 more meals out of what I ordered. The bread they served was truly outstanding! There was some pizza type bread along with plain bread that was so good we had to get a refill.   The dining experience at this restaurant was one of the best I've ever had. The service was outstanding - they truly know what they are doing. They were attentive without being intrusive, the food is prepared deliciously and the ambiance was exemplary. I will definitely be back again soon and can't wait to try all of the items on the menu!",5,1,0,1,0,oLM9piDKbj2PDgy-m3XEcQ

It is pretty far off the beaten path so there isn't a whole lot on the block nor did it seem that close to public transit but parking couldn't have been easier. We were able to wet our appetites with a tasty complimentary owner's creation although it reminded me of naan bread more than pizza. I enjoyed it although it really did not remind me of what I think of as pizza. It was a delightful surprise. I then enjoyed a margarita pizza which had some of the best cheese I had in a while.  Otherwise, there was nothing particularly memorable about it.   This would be a great restaurant for a date but given its remote location and quiet atmosphere, I probably wouldn't go back with a large group or for a big night out.",3,0,0,0,0,0fFLUKl71vv3eNV2xhikEw

If you think Carnivale served the best Mojitos in town....you will definitely be.....Wrong!!! If you order coffee here and ask the server what kind of coffee they served...be carefull cause you will get a smart ass reply of we don't grow coffee in America The food here sucks and is overpriced!! My group order several items from the menu....The Mama Mendez seafood plate was over taken by all the hot spiciness added to this plate. Their version of Pernil is also spicy and it was of great disappointment, since they also served this plate with what they called Puerto Rican Arroz con Gandules which in reality their version of rice is just congri; wich is a Cuban version of Rice with black beans cook together; this rice was also hot spicy and it contains way too many Olives. My friend ordered a Churrasco, and let me tell you; the food proportion for the cost of $32.00 is not worth it...it was way to small and even though we paid a quite pricey dinner ticket at Carnivale (Over $500.00); my friend was still hungry and he ended up eating again at another restaurant. Since we were there to celebrate 3 of our friends birthdays, the server asked us who was a special guest and at the end of our dinner our friends were surprised with a nice plate of ice cream (tres leches) and a small round cake. It was a nice touch, however to our surprised we were charged for it. We were also charged $13.00 for each guacamole the server sent to our table when we first got there. If someone from Carnivale does read this blog....listen please! Not all South American or Caribbean food is served with hot sauce, Aji or it's spicy. If you are planning to serve Puerto Rican food, then I recommend you send your Chef to Puerto Rico to learn how to cook a real Puerto Rican dish of Pernil & Arroz con Gandules. Your Mojitos are not that great and too expensive and your guacamole has too much lime. To our server who I will call on this blog Paul your customer services qualities are yet to be desired.

This past weekend, two friends and I headed to Lao Sze Chaun (only one in the group had been prior and raved about it) - myself and the other person (both NYers) were very excited to try what might finally be great Chinese food. The drive from the West Loop was really quick and although they don't deliver, its definitely close enough to me for a last minute Chinese food craving. Anyway, we pulled up to the packed, but very unassuming restaurant and were told the wait would be about 20 minutes. The place was split in terms of clientele - The Chinese contingent definitely boded well for a great meal. When we finally sat, we are all starving and the menu is ENORMOUS. Many of the things on the menu are very traditional and not really my cup of tea - however, after navigating the menu, I'd say at least 3/4 of it are very accessible for just about anyone who enjoys Chinese food. We settled on the following: Egg drop soup - some of the best I've ever had Green beans in spicy black bean sauce (appetizer) - perfect spice/kick and we housed the dish in like two minutes Pork potstickers - different than any I've had. Cooked perfectly (seemed to be seared then deep fried) and the flavor was phenomenal Spring rolls which I didn't sample (there were only two) Tony's Chicken with hot peppers (don't recall the exact name) but it was great quality white meat chicken battered and deep fried with spicy peppers - AMAZING Szechaun beef tenderloin - nice cut of beef, great array of fresh veggies, and a fantastic slightly spicy sauce Garlic chicken - only had a taste of this, but as the most ""Americanized"" dish we had it was head and shoulders better than any similar dish I've had at any Chinese place in the city. Service was efficient, nothing to write home about but that's the last thing we were worried about. There's tons of places to eat in the one strip where Lao's is located but I think my next trip to Chinatown will be right back to where the experience started!

They don't have a lot of imported alcohols.  Locally sourced everything sounds great unless you're talking about wine, and the selection is a lot of junk from CA, which is frustrating.  No Ketel vodka for the Bloody Marys either, although I will admit that their bloody mix is pretty tasty.   3.  Food is usually hit-or-miss.  Granted, there's a lot more hit than miss but, as far as brunch is concerned, I've not been impressed.  Their breakfast enchiladas were great, but are no longer on the menu.  The chilaquiles were pretty sad and the huevos uncommon was pretty disappointing.  Their lunch and dinner menu features a lot more hits though, specifically the meatloaf, their burgers and mac-and-cheese are all fantastic versions of what could otherwise be lackluster staples.  Here is where the locally sourced really shines. 4. The price.  For a more casual restaurant in this neighborhood the prices are pretty unreasonable.  Makes it hard for us to go regularly, which is a shame because I'm a fan of their dinner menu.  I would say about 2.5 Dollar signs, 3 if you're a heavy drinker.  You'd think all that local booze would be a bit cheaper.",3,1,1,0,0,-pO0hsi0xlF4FwqLGJUizg

Paul Kahn's enemy? a French spy? awful to offal? Nah. Or maybe a bit of each. Whatever. But mostly - it screams that after having tasted paradise on a plate several times in another establishment a couple of blocks south I was expecting better. Clearly, le ""cochon"" has lost the battle against la ""chevre"". Poor little piggy. The second edition of our Sunday night supper club (nothing to do with Wisconsin, it's just a name) took us on Green Street, and we were all excited about it. But at the end of the meal we all agreed that, well, it wasn't that exciting after all. We did a good job of sharing a multitude of dishes though, and were really open-minded and ready to be blown away. It just didn't happen. The sardines were blah, the crudo lacked in acidity, the eggplant had nothing to them, the porchetta was slightly undercooked and dry at the same time, the pig ears tasted like bacon, and overall the presentation was just.........sloppy. I enjoyed the peaches though - deliciously tart - the ribs and the buttermilk dressing on the little gem salad. And my seasonal Three Floyds. Poor harvest. The dessert waffle was outstanding.

WOW.  Amazing We were both looking forward to this restaurant ever since we made our reservations a few months ago.  Helpful note, it is a good idea to make reservations in advanced or you will be waiting for quite a while to grab a seat. Our waiter was spot on.  He helped explain the menu to us and described the best way to possibly order menu items if you weren't wanting an entree.  This came in very handy for my girlfriend as she wasn't completely famished (thank you Lou Malnati) and was not looking for a big gut busting entree.   I had the ceviche trio and wished I had ordered them twice.  The presenation was simple but the flavors were very complex and I found something new that I enjoyed in each one.  She ordered the Fresh Corn Tamales and to quote her ""They were %!*$!% amazing!!"" :)  Being the glutton I am, I followed mine up with the Thursday night special of Chiles Rellenos.  Still drooling about these 4 days later.  Super cheesy, super amazing.  She had the Old School Frontera Trio, which was a small plate along with stealing my Herb green rice, which she was also a big fan of. My one and only complaint is the men's restroom.  It's a two seater (one stall, one urinal), and I destroyed some guy with the door when walking in.  And as fate would have it, I took the door to the face as well upon exiting.  Cut the bar in half and add some room in there please!!",5,1,0,0,0,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w

The atmosphere is very elegant, dark and cozy, sexy and intimate all at the same time which is surprising for such a big space.The first thing you should know about the menu is that the pricing reflects some of the most inexpensive food you can get in river north these days. The cuisine is rustic, inventive with very fresh notes (homemade pastas, etc) and with the owner's background, I would have not expected anything less quite frankly. The wine list features most of the wines under $30 and both times I dined here, the sommelier recommended a great bottle.Overall, service was friendly and attentive and, if we might have waited a little while at times, the ambience made it up for the wait.In conclusion, I wish I would have some criticism, but really, this looks like the kind of establishment that is going to be around for a long time.",5,0,0,0,1,sDYjKyI_67eUhFAqVneYjA

Our dinner for three started out at the bar with wine, appetizers, and $5 martinis. Patrick (manager? GM? owner?) gave us some fabulous suggestions for starters and was incredibly accommodating. He seated us promptly, carried over our drinks/appetizers from the bar to the table, and even brought us little samples of their house infused martini (current selection is cantaloupe - TDF). We later learned that Davanti is associated with Mia Franceca and Francesca's and that he helps to the run the sister restaurants. I consider all of those places super lucky to have Patrick, he is truly an asset to the industry. Among our small plates was the ricotta and honeycomb spread, chicken liver pate, cheese selection/prosciutto, olives, and pizza. My favorite was the ricotta/honey spread which is served in a mason jar with chewy toasted bread (we ordered extra bread per Patrick's suggestion, you definitely need more than three slices). It was such a unique flavor combo and was very light and sweet (but not as sweet as a dessert). The olives were served warm which is a new thing for me but I have to say I liked it. The next best thing we had was the Pizza del Terre with leeks and mushrooms - very earth and packed with flavor. The decor and ambiance of this place is incredible. It's a new twist on rustic Italian - festive, comfortable, warm, and yet it's perfect for a date night or a girls' night out. I can't say enough good things about our night here and I'm looking forward to my next return as soon as possible. Hopefully they'll have a new  house infused martini for me to try (pineapple?! please?!). My only suggestion would be to hire a valet parking service.

Though the restaurant is fairly large, you may find yourself sitting with another party, if your party is small and/or it's busy. But I would say this is a plus, as food and drinks (BYOB, by the way) usually promote conversations! Tank is regularly packed during the meal times, but I find that the quality of the food is not diminished, even when this is the case. Once a table becomes available, you are usually seated promptly. The waiters, in their camo outfits, provide you with a pretty expansive menu. There are various Vietnamese dishes, ranging from chicken/pork/beef dishes to your ever popular Banh Mi sandwiches and pho. Dinner started with a couple shrimp rolls. Each roll had a few shrimps, lettuce, and the radish/noodle. You're also provided with the hoisin sauce and peanut crumbs (favorite part!). At Viet restaurants, I usually get the same item - X-large Special Combination Beef Noodle Soup! I don't know if I'd say that Tank's broth tasted better than other restaurants. However, Tank doesn't skimp on the meats, tendons, meatballs, etc., and the basil/lime/bean sprouts. As for their Banh Mi, I ordered the marinated pork sandwich. The meat was very flavorful and tender. The crunch of the radish, carrots, and cucumbers definitely complimented the meat. And the jalopenos gave the sandwich a kick! The bread was perfect too, slightly crispy and not soggy. Having just come from a long run, I felt pretty stuffed at the end of dinner. On a normal day, I'd probably just go with the spring rolls and pho. You're looking at about $15/person minus t+t for dinner.

4/8/2012,XI3xrgVrJ3Z1WpMphhrh5Q,Keipuw3LUn57N3yzvv4C3w,"Graham Elliott was the singularly worst dining experience of my life.  I took my wife there for her 49th birthday.  I specifically requested a quiet booth. Had the staff been honest they would have told me that this place doesn't exactly do quiet.  I would have had no problem with such an honest disclosure.  I would have taken my $400.00 for a dinner for two and enjoyed a superior dinner at Moto's or some other superior restaurant with better service, food and atmosthpere.  Instead, I endured at shamelessly average 15 course meal from hell served to the sound of shrieking skinhead music at a decibel level that made me pray for the tarmac at O'hare.  If you like the sound of shrieking, screeching guitar music limited to three chords and played at a volume that makes your ears bleed this is your place.  Fine dining, however, this is not.  In the last few months my wife and I have dined atTable 52, Moto's and Graham Elliotts.  Graham Elliots, was definately amateur hour in relation to the other choices. Prior to this meal I never realized how negatively ""background"" music could impact a dining experience.  During my experience at Graham Elliotts, I noticed that the music was not only far too loud, it was also patently obnoxious.The obnoxious chorus of ceasless angry music, made the dining experience incredibly uncomfortable.  My wife and I delighted in the rare moments when the music would stop, only to realize that it was a brief rest between songs.  As the meal progressed we prayed for those rests.  Indeed, the music was more like water boarding, or Chinese water torture than anything else.  Finally, my wife requested that we rush thru the meal to end the whole affair.Ultimately, it was a brilliant idea.  When I could not take the volume any longer I asked if the music could be lowered just a bit.  The response was quite interesting.  I was told that the music was for the chef and that it was something he enjoyed as he cooked.  I felt incredibly lucky that he didn't like to cook to pornography and the sights and sounds of clubbing baby seals.  Finally, I was told that this obnoxious music helped create the atmosphere.  The irony of that response is that it was absolutely correct.  There could not have been more than 10 people in the entire place on the Sunday night we dined at Graham Elliotts. Not the numbers you want to see in a successful restaurant.  I wonder when the owners of this place will draw the correlation between the music and the dining experience.  But that is their problem not mine.My problem is  I should have notice something was wrong when I tried to get a reservation at a dozen other restaurants on the same day.  They were all booked.  Graham Elliotts, however, gave me not only the date I wanted but the exact time I wanted.  In addition, when I checked for the day before and after my wife's birthday.  Those dates were open as well.  Not the sign of a great restaraunt.  Finally, I guess what upset me the most is the shear arrogance of a chef that says to his customers, ""I like the sound of blasting skinhead music when I cook, and if you don't like it go elsewhere.""  Everywhere else I have eaten - dining is an enjoyable experience.  The food should be the main feature. Nothing should distract from the food.  If loud obnoxious music distracts from the food, a chef should play his loud music in his headset and leave his ""guests"" free to enjoy food without distractions.As someone who loves food I am offended by a ""me first"" chef.  Having endured the obnoxious sounds surrounding this mediocre  meal I wonder if this chef ever tried eating at another ""respectful"" restaurant. I certainly hope that this chef leaves Chicago soon. I have seen tons of restaurants fail in Chicago.  I pray this is the next to shut its doors.  I can only hope that before it closes someone takes this idiot Chef and force feeds him hours of bad music and repulsive images - clock work orange style. My headache demands nothing less. As for the services.  My wife and I stood at the door for nearly 7 minutes before someone came to seat us. The waiters attempted to describe the meals to us, but never seemed to realize that we couldn't hear them.As for the food. the foie was delightful, and the pea soup was pretty good. Other than that there was nothing memorable about this meal other than the deserts.  Indeed, the desserts were memorable for precisely how bad they were. Peanut butter and jelly? Really? Oreos for dessert? Yeah, original. Oh, and the Fava bean ice cream.  The waiter took great joy in telling us how unique it was.  The truth was funny.  The idea wasn't new, or even interesting, just poorly executed. In sum, four of the 15 courses were great.  The desserts were inedible, and the rest were forgettable.  The only thing that left an impression about this place was the mind numbing music.  Aspirin and the vow never to return, however, have seem to finally make even that impression go away",1,0,0,0,1,LlHEzxQTiiLJokn2tli35A

After a random sighting of Dale Levitski on Broadway, two giant dogs in tow, I wondered if Dale was working in Chicago. So I Googled him up, and found a Trib article about the rough times he's had since Top Chef, and that he's now the exec-chef at Sprout. Obviously, I Googled Sprout, and found out their specialty is brunch. Amazingly, my specialty is eating brunch, so I made a reservation. The girlfriend and I showed up and were seated quickly. Brunch started out with a pleasant surprise, as we were given a free glass of champagne for checking in on Foursquare. Service was a little bumpy at the beginning, as it seemed the staff did not know who we belonged to, but everyone who helped us was friendly. When our actual waiter asserted his claim, we ordered cocktails, the Bugeymosa for the girl and a Rumaki Fizz for me. The Rumaki Fizz was startling; it tasted exactly like a Hawiian glazed ham. It was not thirst quenching really, but it was interesting and fun. It is the first thing I tell people about Sprout. We ordered and began chatting.

I ordered the corncakes (pancakes made from corn meal) and cheese grits. The cheese grits are great and the corn cakes are good too.  The corncakes taste like cornbread with corn kernels in the batter and a subtle sweetness (like fresh corn on the cob).   It comes with a red pepper sauce that is a bit sweet and adds for a nice taste to the corn cakes.  I should've put some syrup on the corncakes to see how that would have tasted but I didn't think of it at the time.

Being from South Louisiana, I tend to take two approaches to mustard: use it straight, or use it to flavor something, such as remoulade. I think when you try to flavor mustard with something like basil, it doesn't work so well. Better to use mustard on the sausage and add some fresh basil on top, I think.

The cuisine is ""coastal southern"" which works out to lots of hearty southern fare with a more than your usual mix of seafood, crabcakes, etc. This isn't diner food -- while brunch is clearly a great idea, it's up a notch from the Golden Nugget. The food is, without question, among my favorites in Chicago. It's also locally and sustainably sourced, which is rad. Things I like there: they do a biscuits and gravy that is so complicated you feel like that traditional white gravy was somehow cheating you. It's a redeye gravy over sweet potato biscuits, and comes with a big pile of southern greens and andoulle sausage. Mwah! The Eggs New Orleans is also ridiculously good. Poached eggs over crab cakes over hash brown potatoes. So money. There's other things to like about Big Jones -- wait staff is friendly and prompt, decor is interesting, drink list is complicated and good (a Bloody Mary is  thick with actual spices and veggies, not pulped mixer). But mostly, it's the food. The glorious food. I never have a problem getting seated right away, and at $10-15 for most of the good stuff, it's a steal.

They carve the duck at the table side and left so much meat on the bone that even my 17 year old daughter noticed and made comment. The waiter said that they use the rest of the duck to make the soup and duck fried rice which is included in the hefty $38 price. However, it appeared that much of the remaining meat left on the carcass did not appear in the fried rice or the soup. The Peking duck was good but is not actually made with the real Peking duck cooking method, the duck broth tasted like it was made with a boullion cube and the fried rice was nothing special and tasted like any other type of fried rice. We would have been better off separately ordering their roast duck which at least one could be sure was the entire duck for $16.75 with all its meat still attached to it and actually served on your table instead of next to it and then wheeled away, a plate of fried rice and soup. We also ordered beef chow fun and they put spicy green chilis in the dish. Really? The normal, authentic recipe for chow fun is NOT spicy. While the waiter apologized nicely, he made no effort to make up for that error. It's still in my refrigerator and no one will touch it. Ever since this restaurant moved from its former, humble storefront around the corner on Argyle, they have gotten farther and farther away from authentic, economic Chinese dishes.

The former was skimpy given the size of our group (5) while the former tasted little more than melted Hershey's kisses. Both times we had to ask for more dipping breads or fruit. We only ordered 4 entrees thinking we would have more than enough food. We were wrong. I have had more beef and chicken on a kabob than what was served here. The entree platter was heavy on broccoli, green peppers and onions, not exactly what you would think of deep frying in a fondue pot.

I don't want this little drive-in to get too busy; to the point I won't find a parking spot!! Although I will share the joy and spread the good news of how great Superdawgs hot dogs and burgers are! All in hope they grow and open another location soon! Superdawg has a lot of history in Chicago. The owners I have met and spoken to various times. This Drive-in only has one location which is on Milwaukee Avenue in Chicago, IL. I do not have a clue why people have posted Superdawgs location as Wheeling, IL. Anyhow...the drive-in is owned by a family. Started with the grandparents and now has 3 generations running it plus employees. To eat here you need a CAR! That's maybe a negative to some of you. You could eat inside the restaurant...well more like inside the little room. It only has 4 tables and some bar tables. It gets pretty cold! During the Summer you can enjoy your tasty burgers and hot dogs with your crinkled cut fries outside, on one of their 2-4 outside tables. But best way to eat at this place is in your car. They have plenty of space for parked cars. Service is fairly quick. Waitresses are not rude but they may not also be VERY friendly. They are your average waitress that brings your food to your car in hope of a good tip. Their menu is pretty big considering their small kitchen! They have various types of burgers, hot dogs, desserts and sodas. They even sell Tamales! No idea why! It's a little weird but hey there's a little bit of everything on this menu for all kinds of cravings. Their pineapple milk shake is DELICIOUS! Definitely worth trying! They do not serve alcohol but seriously if you are eating in your car you can BYOB! My only BIG complaint is their small little kitchen that at times seems to be a little abandoned. Seems like the kitchen needs a little remodeling and maintenance! �They do need to remodel this (one and only) location or somehow fix it up a little bit, mostly to just give it a better presence and feel. Superdawg would get all 5 stars from me if they would remodel and add more tables!

We got 2 chocolate espresso (it wakes you up right away), 1 agua de Jamaica (refreshing), 1 huevos rancheros, 1 egg chorizo torta and 3 churros with chocolate sauce (the chocolate sauce is to die for). A very satisfying meal, bold favors, very refreshing sauces, roasted tomatillo for the torta and roasted tomatoes on the huevos rancheros. All this experience for only around $30.

Back in June, I had organized a large surprise dinner for my girlfriend to celebrate her grad school graduation. The food was great, the service was good, and if my story ended there, I would be giving this place 4 stars. Alas, she and I returned the next evening, having realized that we likely had left flowers and several graduation cards (some, we found out after-the-fact, with money in them) in a gift bag at the restaurant. Upon our return, we discovered that, despite restaurant management having my name and cell phone number from organizing the party, (1) our flowers had been placed in a vase and put on display in the restaurant, and (2) only one card was left, which for reasons unknown, the owner had stored in his car. When we asked what had happened to the bag and the rest of the cards, the owner became needlessly defensive. When he somewhat angrily and sarcastically offered to have his staff check the dumpster from the night before, we took him up on the offer. After about 10 minutes of our waiting awkwardly in a crowded restaurant, the owner and accompanying employees returned with the gift bag in tow, which was torn and empty but for a bunch of coffee grinds. Now, that should have been the end of it; however, the owner, apparently being the sensitive type, then had an employee fetch our flowers from the shelf on which they were perched, after which the owner rather dramatically proceeded to throw the flowers into the bag, even more dramatically followed by his tossing the bag at me.  (If only his principled stand had extended to throwing back at us our $800+ from the night before.) And as if the point even needed to be made, the owner pronounced that my girlfriend and I were banned from his establishment. After telling him I thought he needed to ease up on the steroids and then walking out of the restaurant with my girlfriend, as if to confirm my point, the owner decided to follow us out of the restaurant so that he could yell at us as we walked down the street.

Once I was certain I was going to live, I perused the menu and ordered margaritas for my companion (who was running late) and myself.  I am very partial to Cesar's margaritas, so I was prepared to be disappointed.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I ordered the Patron margarita, mango flavor.  It was very smooth and quite tasty, but for $12.50 I could have gotten twice the margarita at Cesar's. I ordered the chicken flautas, which were good but a touch overdone.  Not tooth-chipping hard, but a few seconds less in the deep fryer would have made them that much better.  The rice and beans had fantastic flavor!  My friend had a quesadilla that she seemed to enjoy.  We finished up by sharing the fried ice cream, which was pretty comparable to, say, Chi-Chi's (does that place still exist?).",3,0,0,0,0,xXSMc3pDWTRQHLgjBTtTUg

I don't know where else you can get a hot dog like this, so this was a real treat. I've also had the Saucisson Alsacienne, which is/has: ""Bacon Sausage with Creme Fraiche, Caramelized Onions and Crascenza Cheese."" Dee-licious. Best hot dog I've ever had in my life.

The beer - AWARD WINNING for a reason.  My favorites are the Dark n Curvy and the Worryin Ale.  They also have a great bottle list in case you want to have something outside of their own brew.3.  The appetizers - a very short list, but the warm spinach and tomato dip is very tasty.4. The atmosphere - busy, for a reason.  so show up, put your name in, and stand by the bar with beers while you wait for your table.  There are plenty of TVs with sports on.  Thursday and Saturday they have karaoke, and it's good stuff.  For big groups they have a lower area up front so if you want to throw a party they will hook you up.5.

The atmosphere wasn't intimate, and unfortunately still felt like we were in a hotel (yes, I know it is a hotel restaurant, but the restaurant should feel like a separate dining experience when you enter in my opinion). The food was decent. The Serrano ham and fig salad was really good, but I thought the extra smoked bacon was unnecessary and overpowered the other flavors. The scallops were the best part of my meal with the roasted eggplant puree and wisp of basil sauce very delicious and melding together. I couldn't eat any of the dessert options so they were kind to substitute cheese instead, which were good. My husband, however, enjoyed the milk chocolate croquettes with banana marshmallow to no end and suggested I take a bite and suffer through a few hours of pain (from my allergy) because it would be worth it for how amazing they are. I did not, but his final course did determine that this review was at least 3 stars. Recommendation? Just go for dessert.",3,0,0,0,0,o4NcUfco7JxOcyfKFWyAhg

A pillow that was filled with earl grey-scented air. Despite your better judgment, you wanted to eat the pillow, it smelled that good. You were served an assortment of dishes that featured crab in forms that you never considered, namely an icy crab sorbet. And it was delicious. Your dishes were paired with wines from all corners of the globe, and their exceptional deliciousness transformed you into a pretentious and dissatisfied oenophile for a good month. Once the meal was over, you went downstairs and stared through the glass windows that looked out on the kitchen, observing Grant Achatz and his team of chefs work their magic. You felt like a kid at the north pole, watching Santa and his elves. You stayed there, observing, for maybe half an hour or so, as other guests followed your lead and joined the show, your eyes glazing over with delight and bitter-sweetness, since that epic meal was now over, and your wallet was significantly lighter.

It was great to people watch: others at the table, diners at in the stalls, and people hanging out at the bar tables. If you don't want the communal, you can eat at a table or eat at the bar but I think eating at the communal table is something to try at least once. As for the food, I ordered the Cobia Crudo to start. The cobia was sashimi-grade with avocado and grapefruit which was in a marinade that consisted of olive oil, a light vinegar, and diced shallots. Amazing! After I finished it, I ordered a second one. It was just that good. For dessert, I ordered the Waffle which came with honey butter and peach jam. Before the dessert came out, the server brought out a complimentary glass of homemade limoncello. The limoncello was the best I have ever had. As for the Waffle, it was the best waffle ever.

""Apparently they do national delivery!"" I said. ""Yeah, but I'm not gonna pay $30 to have it delivered to me,"" he replied. ""I love that you know exactly how much the delivery would cost."" Let me clarify that I wasn't disappointed by Giordano's pizza. There are other reviews that echo the bad service and I have to say that it's true. Firstly, it's extremely confusing that the official website lists this location under 130 E Randolph St but it's actually on 135 E Lake St. We placed a carry out order online for a sausage and mushroom pizza which went through fine, but when we went to the front desk (dine in) to ask for our order the hostess said no such order existed and that they didn't do carry out. Confused, we walked around the block several times and saw a sign for Giordano's on Randolph, but couldn't figure out how to access what we thought was a different location. When we called to ask for directions, they told us to go on Lake St, which was even more confusing. ""Should we go in and ask again?"" my friend said--until we saw the ""carry out & delivery"" entrance on the side of the building. When we went in and got our pizza, I think the cashier recognized my voice and asked us where we had gone the first time. After I told him we had initially gone to the front, he said, ""Oh, yeah, she doesn't know anything about the carry out."" ......................................okay. However, I don't think their service will improve any time soon since they know the strength of their pizza will keep customers coming. Don't get me wrong, their pizza was pretty good, but after a few slices, the realization that you're basically biting into a giant slab of cheese hits you and it starts to get kind of gross. I seriously LOVE cheese and it started to become too much for me after about two slices. It's definitely worth a try as a novelty, but I don't think I would get this again. Lou Malnati's is way better. I feel like most of my friends who recommended Giordano's haven't tried Lou's yet. Now THAT'S a pizza that can stand by the strength of its ingredients and the quality of its crust alone, as opposed to relying on an insane amount of cheese to give flavor. Giordano's is a pretty good one night stand, but Lou Malnati's is my main squeeze.",3,5,2,2,0,ms5ge1XY9-Alu7HkybAMdQ

The eggs were poached to perfection, but the english muffin should have been toasted longer. It was very soggy by the time the plate arrived. The breakfast burrito seemed to be average. It is basically scrabbled eggs and guacamole stuffed into a giant tortilla. The best part of breakfast was the red velvet hotcake. It is as delicious as it sounds!

I tried both and both tasted great, however, when it comes to burgers I have a more simplistic taste and didn't feel ""The Gage"" was worth $6 more than the ""Regular"" which was priced very reasonably for the menu. My other friend got the Semolina Dumplings - which she raved about. So the food and drinks were great. The service, not so much. Let me start by saying that all three of us are in the service industry and have high expectations. The menu at The Gage does not have the most common plates in general. We first had a discussion about what Semolina actually is and figured it out between us. Out of curiosity, we then asked our server, sort of as a ""test"". She failed miserably. While we were visiting (we hadn't seen each other in nearly a year!) she kept on asking if she could take our plates away when we were clearly not finished. This was highly irratating.

It is a great idea but the execution could be a lot better.Have you ever eaten at a restaurant that is under so much pressure that it reminds you of a scene from Apocalypse Now. The scene where there is this kid in a bunker trying to find out who his COO is. He doesn't know whats going on, and he is going to find out any time soon. Shaws was that kid in the bunker this afternoon.So I got to Shaws at 3:20 pm and the 25 cent oyster deal had only been offered for 20 minutes. the grill room was packed and it was obvious that the staff was under pressure. After a 15 minute wait I got a stool by the bar (really nice host got me a seat and I was able to get enough elbow room for myself). And then the waiting started..........I eventually got my order put in after being seated 25 minutes earlier. The bar tender was under real pressure but was trying his best. I didn't care that there was a wait, I was getting Oysters for 25 cent so I just read my book that I brought with me. The idiot next to me was complaining about the wait but of course never had the courage to ask to speak to the manager or even just politely ask the bartender how much longer the oysters would take to get served. When I put through my order I noticed that people were putting through huge orders. A guy behind me ordered 4 dozen oysters and he was eating on his own, crazy.I really enjoyed the oysters when they came out, they were as good as any I have had in Chicago and I couldn't fault them. I asked for the check and made a point of telling the bartender that he had done a great job when he was clearly short staffed.I'm sure Shaws is better than a 3 star review but going by the confusion and wait time today, I can't give it more than a 3.",3,0,0,0,1,dKcO9OQ44RPRlkWe-vToFA
5/27/2009,HSrg,aDlwg8N82TY66pSo1eFhkA,"It's hard to really explain the way Chicago deep dish is regarded in New York. It's a bit of a curiosity to most, who may have ventured to Pizzeria Uno, but still hold on to the belief that nothing can possibly unseat the superiority of the New York thin crust. Now, I'm actually a fan of Pizzeria Uno, although I know that's not cool to say. So believe me when I tell you that I was extremely excited to sink my teeth into some deep doughy goodness. The first thing that strikes you at Gino's East is the graffiti that is covering the place. It creates a cool welcoming vibe, that makes you immediately regret not bringing spray paint along with you to lunch. But not to worry, the wait staff will happily provide you with crayons and white out so that you can properly leave your mark. When taking our order, the waiter dutifully informed us that we would be waiting 45 minutes until our food arrived, and that we might want to get an appetizer of sorts in case we got bored sniffing white out and waiting. We wound up with an unnecessary fried crap platter with Mozzarella Sticks, Calamari and Spinach Sticks. Believe you me... just wait and sniff. You don't need all that grease sitting in your stomach when the main course arrives. The pizza was good, but ultimately disappointing. The cornmeal crust left a sort of strange taste that left a bit to be desired. All this negativity did not mean I didn't enjoy my meal... because I actually did. I just wanted a bit more. The worst thing about it, is that as I was leaving, I couldn't help but think that the Pizzeria Unos that I had been to on the East Coast were better. But I recognize that Gino's East may not be the best example of Chicago deep dish. So that in itself means that I'll need to drag myself back to the Windy City to give their pizza another go.

The semi-private room was nice because the curtains let you see the rest of the room and keep it from feeling close, while it still feels as though you are in a more intimate setting. We presented the service staff with a challenge that they seem adroit in handling: a broad range of arrival times. Three or four people arrived first around 5:30, I got there a little after 6:00, another joined at nearly 7:00 and the eighth (who was arriving from the airport and was not expected given the need for last-minute travel) arrived sometime between 7:00 and 8:00. The staff was attentive the whole time, bringing fresh hors d'oeuvre happily around and never making us feel hurried. The thin-cut steak that was offered as one of our two entree options was excellent, as were the hors d'oeuvre.

When we checked in we were told we had a one hour and 45 minute wait. You can pre-order your pizza at the when you hit the hour mark. While waiting outside near the hostess, a foreign speaking couple approached and did not understand they had to go in the restaurant to place their name on the list. It was then a young man who was waiting behind me began to tell the couple to ""get out of here, go away,"" because they had trouble communicating. I told him to leave them alone. Once I defended the couple, they young man turned his anger on me spewing vulgarities. The hostess, a very young woman, kept apologizing to me and contacted a manager. She explained what occurred to the manager, Robert who did nothing. He acted as if nothing happened, ignoring what had occurred to the Italian couple and what was said to me. The young man was forced in the building by his friend. At the hour mark, my husband went in to order his pizza the young man returned, stood at the door way and called me several ""f"" names. Again, the hostess went for Robert. My husband returned and I told him what happened. Robert was addressing the young man in the doorway my husband approached and told him he wanted this to stop. Robert and two other managers, proceeded to tell my husband to ""stay outside and he will stay inside."" Why we stayed I have no idea, but we did. I think we were both in shock.

I've been wanting to eat here for some time. It's right off the Kedzie brownline stop so I'd always see it while passing it on the el. I'm part Middle-eastern so I always appreciate it when I find a good Middle-eastern restaurant. This place is Persian, though. But close enough for me. Sorry, too much backstory, I know... Point is, the food here was on point. Meat and chicken were tender, juicy, flavorful (man I am craving it all over again just thinking about it).... the rice was perfect (I had the dill rice, my significant other had the white-- both were scrumptous) Ordered hummus for an appetizer. Like I said, I'm part Middle-eastern, so I know good hummus when I taste it, and this was good hummus! Bread was warm, cut in convenient little triangles. We went there for lunch and it was packed! (there's a free parking lot by the way.... though street parking is fairly easy) This was at around 2-ish. After standing awkwardly by the door for five minutes, and then moving inward towards the ""waiting area"" I guess you could call it, we were finally seated. The service was friendly and fast, despite how busy they seemed to be. Best of all, the owner (I think he was the owner?), this jolly fellow, asked us if it was our first time there, to which we replied ""why, yes, sir, it actually is!"" and so he said, ""by golly! we have some new comers! well, you must receive special treatment for joining us today!"" Five minutes later he gives us a 3-part platter with 3 different appetizers. So that was really nice. And those appetizers were very tasty indeed. The place has a warm, comfy feel. Nice decor and cozy set-up. The only thing lacking was a touch of background music... though the hum of coversation that hovered as we enjoyed the deliciousness that was our meal..... gave it a nice, communal feeling. You'd think all that chatter  would be annoying, but for some reason it surprisingly wasn't. I've been places where the chatter-filled ambience is unbearable. But I suppose because this place isn't huge, the volume factor was pretty controlled. And anyway, who knows, maybe their speakers were down that day or something.

We love this place -- the food is usually great, the service is usually great  it's on a par with or better than much more expensive places that are located downtown. The night we went, the service was unbelievably bad. We could hardly believe it was the same place. Where to start? First of all, we were there for 2 hours and 45 minutes -- far too long for any dinner (yeah, that could be us, but we've never spent more than an hour-and-a-half in a restaurant). Two of the main courses were overcooked. The waiter and staff were very slow in clearing the table. I asked for a spicy Bloody Mary -- it wasn't spicy at all (not a crime, I know, but it would have been easy for them to take care of). A busboy dropped a couple of things and cursed in front of our children. Our first waiter was not especially friendly (they replaced him in mid-meai). I hate to say this, but I think it's true: I believe a table of 4 businessmen would have been treated better than we were -- much better. I've probably been to Sabatino's 15-20 times. Great place, but the restaurant blew it on a very big occasion for us. I wrote the owner about it a couple of days after the meal. He never wrote back. The meai cost $170.....I'd like to go back and give Sabatino's another chance....but after a dinner like that, I'm not in any rush.

At Giordano's we enjoyed the 12-inch SPECIAL with sausage, onions, green peppers and onions. It seemed deeper, BTW, than the one at Malnati's.

And, after an afternoon of drinking and losing all ability to tell time, we were promptly seated after showing up for our ever-dynamic reservation over a half-an-hour early. After we were corraled into our seats (our table was a wooden pig-pen type dinning situation in which wooden gates kept us from wandering about), we were told that we were lucky enough to be here on a day when there was a fixed, two-brothers-brewing-co inspired menu and beer pairings. We were also apparently lucky enough to have chosen a day when our bill would ultimately surpass $100 per person, including the beer pairing and tip. The first dish was a cured ham. As I'm not an expert in all things fancy, I'll just hope someone else on yelp can better document the dish's title, it was explained to me that this was a pig only bred in a certain part of the world, and was thus, very, very fancy. It was a thinly cut slice of 'ham' from a type of 'pig' i'd never heard of before that was so delicious ... I started to question it's origin, and started to get worried about the 'real' reason they were locking us in gates and filling us with beer & food and emptying our wallets. But, the more I thought about it, the more I realized I didn't even care, this wouldn't be a bad way to go. The decor was both modern and rustic, minimilistic and quaint. Plus, eating family style on mis-matched antique china was an endearing touch.

Hmmm...if excellent customer service had been included, I'd say yes, definitely yes. Unfortunately, this was not the case. We waiting in line for about 15 minutes, which, for a Saturday night.....sure. Especially considering the hype this place has received. Our party of 3 gets seated at a empty 6, maybe 7, top table. We order drinks and an app. Digging the atmosphere. Good vibe...so far, so good. They tell us they may need to seat more people at our table. No problem, we think and say. Enter waitress/hostess 5-10 minutes later. Tells us that they are going to seat a large party next to us. She offers to move us to a ""better"" table, and provide a round of shots or a round of drinks - on the house - for our trouble. I look at my girlfriend, and we agree, sure, we'll move. Especially for a free round of drinks. Seated at our new booth table - definitely not a better table, as promised, by the way  - we continue to sip on our beverages and are having a good night. Soon enough, we're all running low and decide it's time to cash in on those promised drinks. We order, and the manager comes over and states - AND I QUOTE - "" Are you sure you guys don't want a round of shots?"". It's clear she's trying to cheap us out of the aforementioned round of cocktails. We say, ""No, thank you, we'd rather have drinks."" She says, ""Are you sure?"", to which we reply, ""Yes, we'd rather order from the menu!"" And so we do. And then continue our happy chattering. Fast forward to 1/2 hour-45 minutes later, when we ask for the check. What does it say? ONE drink comped. Ummmm? Here's the issue, Violet Hour. I loved you when I walked in. We would all have gotten 2 drinks/pp ANYHOW. But your waitress/hostess told us ""shots"" or ""drinks"". Note the PLURAL. Not one. We explain the situation to the waiter and he goes to talk to the ""manager"". 5 minutes pass. 10 minutes pass. FINALLY, this woman comes over to our table and says that she oh-so-clearly stated we were offered a ""round of shots"" or ONE drink. Which could not have been further from the truth. Not only did she reiterate this inaccurate point over-and-over to the point of complete annoyance, but the worst part was she came BACK again with a horrible 'tude and stated, ""I'm going to do this, but i hope you know you got $36 worth of drinks comped."" And turned on her heel with an air of complete bitchiness. I've never experienced such piss-poor customer service, especially in a city with so much competition. She ruined the entire experience for us all.

Because of this, they have no incentive to provide customers with basic service like offering water, tea or just general courtesy. I did like that their employees wore army/camouflage shirts. Goes very well with the ""tank"" theme. Supposedly, this is one of the better pho places in Chicago but I found it to be mediocre at best. The broth was bland and couldn't be fixed with hoisin sauce, siracha or lemon. It was missing a certain pho-ness to it. The prices are comparable to CA pho but definitely not in taste. They also have rice plates, noodle dishes and Vietnamese sandwiches so you can try your luck with those. One thing that stood out to me was the portion.

Newcomers like myself should be aware that there are two entrances, one for dinner only, so make sure you keep looking until you find the lunch door. They do a lot of takeout but have a large seating area as well, and we were able to sit right away. I ordered some mango juice to start, and it came out in a delicate little champagne flute. I'd have loved a larger glass of the yummy stuff, but it was sweet and wonderfully refreshing. We started with some chips and guac, which was just what the doctor ordered. They aren't skimpy in providing their guac  and there was much more left after we ran out of chips. They also offered us some toasted bread rounds, which made decent guac dipping devices. For my entrée, I decided very quickly to go with the Cuban sandwich, as this is a Cuban place and it seemed like one of their specialties. I was in love from the first bite - the bread was grilled and crunchy, the cheese was wonderfully melted and the pickle was thinly sliced so as not to be overwhelming. It came with a side of plantain chips, which weren't quite crunchy enough. Others got some less exciting looking salads and an interesting Mexican chicken sandwich. The service was quick and friendly and I noticed there was some outdoor seating too, perfect for lunch hour on a warm day when you want to soak in some fresh air before heading back to the office.

We were a little surprised to see a dozen huge lightly battered and fried shrimp drenched in a savory, custard looking sauce with sugared walnuts on the side.  We just couldn't get past the heaviness of the sauce and the strange texture difference between the fried shrimp and the sauce.  I would definitely recommend asking for the sauce on the side.",3,0,0,0,0,KomhK0JD5cleEW55YTw7MQ

My meal came with a salad with a light vinagrette and also 3 pieces of sushi (spicy tuna or cali roll.) I choose the spice tuna and it was really good - they spice the tuna instead of using spicy mayo. The adobo was different from what I am used to but it was still fabulous. The sauce wasn't as vinegary as I like, but it still had great garlic and soy flavors. I dug the grilled onions in the dish (also not what I am used to) - they were cooked to the point of perfect carmelization. The pork and chicken were seasoned well and not overcooked/dry.

Super cheesy pizza is usually not my thing, but the combination of sauce and crust on their pizza is too delicious and too extraordinary to ever resist. I am a pizza LOVER (and saying that is an understatement), and out of every Chicago pizza place I've been to  the Art of Pizza is definitely top 5. Not only do they have slices, which is perfect when I do not have time to wait or don't want a whole pizza, they also have three different types of pizza: deep dish, thin crust, and pan. The pan is my favorite because it is cheesy without too much sauce. The dough is also great. I have had all three types, but the pan seems to win out every time. The pepperoni is seasoned with spices so it tastes extra delicious. Too bad I gave up eating red meat a month ago :( Sometimes during busy hours the selection of slices is sub-par, but usually there is always a pizza getting ready to come out of the oven so I've never had any real problems in this department. I am always willing to wait an extra 5-10 minutes for a piping hot slice! They also have a large selection of appetizers and pastas, so there is always something for everybody. The daily specials are great if you live in the area and are looking for a cheap pasta meal. The only reason I didn't give them 4 stars is because it can get a bit pricey, but that is to be expected for superior Chicago pizza. Oh yeah, and they have a parking lot!

She was VERY friendly but since she was working the bar and the tables we received lukewarm service at best, this was not her fault, as I mentioned she was very nice but was running around the whole time trying to serve everyone.  We ordered wings, both tangy BBQ and buffalo, and after about 25 minutes a humongous platter of wings arrived.  They were extremely dark and tasted like someone had burt two inches if breading on them in a blast furnace.  The coating was very hard and crunchy, not crispy, but very tough and crunchy, we're it not for the buffalo sauce softening them up I am not sure they would have even been edible.  Unfortunately the BBQ sauce could not save the second order, they tasted like burt toast.  When asked how we liked the wings we said they tasted really overcooked and sent the BBQ wings back as indelible but were charged anyway.  The four courser arrived cold, the deep fried jalapeños were chewy and tasted like they had been cooked that morning and the waffleized mac and cheese was also cold and absolutely tasteless, like a slab of room temperature starch.  I am not sure how a person can make mac and cheese with no flavor but they somehow managed to pull it off.  Finally the pork was OK but had no seasoning that I could taste, and I feel like a lot of restaurants over salt things.  At the end of the meal we got a bill for $65.00 for two, both of us drinking soda, three appetizers and two sandwiches. We tried to ask the bartender why we were charged for burt food that was sent back but another server showed up at some point and they were too busy loudly discussing the server's party night.  We were extremely disappointed as our hopes were high going in, even if it were just OK I would have been fine but this was a very bad experience except for the delicious fries and amazing deep friend cheese curds.",1,1,0,0,0,6gZTET0y7ARZMrbJRmI2mw

The service here on a Wednesday night was attentive and I love the fact gthat it's BYOB. However, it is heavy, heavy, heavy on the parts of American Italian cuisine that I really don't like--i.e. lots of raw garlic in everything and heavy red sauce on most items that gave me serious indigestion for the rest of the night. We started with the brushetta, sans mozzarella as we were both hoping for a lighter meal. It was okay, but lacking fresh basil and the overabundance of raw garlic wasn't doing it for me. I wanted something with lots of veggies, so I selected two apps: the sauteed mushrooms with wine and the eggplant with mozz. Unfortunately, both were smothered in a red sauce that had lots of raw garlic (not sauteed at all--clearly just stirred into the sauce) and both were oversalted and heavy. The house bread was soft, bland, and not crusty at all--clearly store bought, so it wasn't great to sop up the veggies as I'd hoped. My husband had homemade papardelle with an eggplant sauce. The eggplant were nice, but the sauce was again, full of that raw garlic. Maybe if we would've gotten a non-red sauce dish (i.e. one of the cream sauces), this would've been remedied, as their homemade pasta had a nice texture and flavor. But we aren't huge fans of heavy on the cheese and cream sauces. BTW--the portions here are HUGE, but pricey ($22 for a simple vegetarian pasta dish?), and they charge you $8 to split an entree. So, we left here having had an app and the equivalent of two veg entrees with no alcohol or dessert for over $60. Pretty pricey, if you ask me. Which all leads me to: who said that raw garlic = Italian? I don't know, unless you're lightly seasoning with raw garlic in an app or dressing. Raw garlic has no place in a cooked sauce! Or as a topping for bread (though rubbing a slice of toasted bread lightly with a garlic clove is a good idea)! No one does that in Italy--just ask Marcella Hazan (http://bit.ly/gKo14W): Q. What is the biggest mistake we still make in cooking Italian food? A. Too much garlic! Too much ruins everything. We say in Italy that what you keep out is as important as what you put in.

I'd rather watch Discovery Channel over the Playboy Channel (assuming my hijacked SPICE network is on the fritz). Whatever the case, I've embraced my inner-nerd and celebrate it (with close friends only).  For these reasons, I suppose that  I would have a natural interest and affinity towards molecular gastronomy.  Ground-breaking chefs such as Ferran Adria and Pierre Gagnaire push the limits of food and really make us reconsider everything we know about cuisine. Well friends, after dining at Alinea, I believe Grant Achatz deserves to be listed with the heavy-hitters of molecular gastronomy. Now let me remind you all that wifey and I are not toothless hillbillies who are easily fooled with smoke and mirrors.  If something tastes bad, we'll say it tastes bad no matter how much you manipulate or dress it up.  We've eaten at places that try to wow their customers with ridiculous foams, lavender perfumes, and lobster-scented bubble-baths... we weren't fooled.  Molecular gastronomy is a powerful  tool.  But when it's done poorly, everything on your plate just seems pathetically silly. Options at Alinea are simple, choose the tasting or the tour menu.  If you want to do the tour menu, you'll have to commit when you make the reservation (typically 2 months in advance). You'd better go with the tour, or you're an idiot. Brief version:   22 courses, nearly 5 hours. - At least 4 courses involved liquid nitrogen. - 2 courses involved warnings by our server of possible ""explosion"". - 3 courses included custom-made utensils which could poke your eye out... - 4 courses included live plants Long version: Wifey and I are fairly quick eaters.  If food is set in front of us, we'll gleefully shove it in our gullets and chew later.  The pace at Alinea was very good, with stuff coming out pretty quickly.  Despite this, nearly five hours lapsed from beginning to end.  I felt like we were in some time-warp because the dinner seemed to pass by so quickly.  Another benefit of molecular gastronomy!! The showmanship and creativity were truly breathtaking.  Many courses were highlighted by unique bowls, plates, and utensils created especially for that particular dish.  Other offerings were accented simply with embellishments by mother nature herself.  A branch of oak leaves, a single hyacinth stalk,  a fat gob of brook trout roe... mmmmm brook trout roe. If you can set aside the snake-oil and smoke, the food is absolutely astounding.  Because many courses consist of a single bite, swallow, or ""explosion"", the flavors have to be concentrated  and ""spot-on"" or the entire course is a waste of time.  In these single morsels, Chef Achatz's genius is revealed.  That liquid nitrogen or burnt bread reduction isn't puffery, it's methodically and painstakingly utilized to make the food better. Better food through science... Alinea would give Vulcans orgasms. You'd better believe that our Chicago experience was highlighted by our dinner at Alinea.  It beats deep-dish pizza by a country mile!",5,9,7,7,0,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA

We also decided to try a typical traditional Greek dessert, called Loukoumades, which wasn't really my thing.The service was good and the food was nice, so I would like to recommend this place to everybody!",4,0,0,0,1,UQ3cGi3GdBljE3i2_qLcBQ

Plenty of great craft brews from all over this great country and beyond. The food was fantastic. All 5 burgers ordered at our table received rave reviews. The different fry seasons were also a huge bonus. I ordered the firecracker fries. I was pleasantly surprised at the burn they offered. Spicy, but also very flavorful. The only thing that keeps this from getting a five is the service. Considering the place wasn't that busy and there were 2 server and a bartender, we should have never had an empty beer for the 10 minutes we did.

4/8/2009,dqsT7YcI7dNWoF-K_Wzu-g,T9jRi4U2RQr40KGw_EGtgw,"This is my third review, my second after the one on DHResumes. You'll find that my comments will generally follow what Grams' always told me, ""Don't say nothin' at all if you ain't got nothin' good to say."" According to Yelp's stats that seems to separate me from more than 50% of Yelpers. In other words, I'll leave the berating to other people, while I'll review the places that I truly enjoy. For my culinary credentials, I grew up in a family that owns several restaurants that create amazing food. I have no association with any of the restaurants that I am reviewing other than that I eat at the mentioned locations and their food makes my stomach happy. Claro?Gino's East is Chicago. I've grown up eating this pizza and the memories are fond. This is the first Gino's East that my mom took me. I remember entering through the doors at a mere seven- or eight-years-old. The decor, which you may have heard about, frightened me and my two older brothers. The door to the downstairs opens right to the bar. There is pen, White-out and marker graffiti covering the walls, ceilings, tables and doors. I thought ""This is a mistake"" and shuffled closer to my mother's arms. The truth about Gino's East is that it is a family restaurant, safe, sound, cozy, and full of fragrant scents and delicious tasting pizza. My #1, hands down favorite pizza joint in Chicago is Gino's East.Warning: If you are a college student or a competitive eating man, you have never faced the delightful, mouthwatering challenge of eating Gino's deep dish pizza. Take all of your boasts (true or otherwise) about eating 3 whole pizzas in college and bow in humbleness. Your mouth and eyes will be wanting, but your belly will fill after four slices. Gino's East pizzas are definitely pizza pies.Things I Recommend:* Allowing yourself 45 minutes to be served. Deep dish pizzas take longer to bake.* Going on a near, but not empty stomach. The food is scrumptious and filling, but you need something in your tank to get through the preparation wait.* Order only 1 appetizer dish, unless you want to bring an entire pizza home. Trust me, the pizzas are filling.* Go for the pizza with cornbread crust. It's excellent and unique.* Choose the patty sausage (if you're a meat-eater). Imagine how cakes are layered and you'll be able to envisage how Gino's constructs pizzas - a) Layer of deep dish crust? Check! b) Layer of fresh tomato sauce? Check! c) Layer of patty sausage? Check! Wow! Really, check! d) Layer of cheese? Check! Delicious, I'm stuffed. No, you have another piece. Man this pizza is filling. I am humbled and satisfied...* Leave your boasting about eating pizza at the door.* Try to store a wedge of Gino's East pizza in a cheek pocket using the squirrel mouth storage method.* Sign your initials and date of attendance on a wall, chair or other surface.* Remember the experience.",5,0,0,0,1,ibreTMGGaQSanZttUchjKg

On this evening, I accompanied a rather large group of my fellow bon vivant culinary adventurers to Little Bucharest. From the very moment of arrival we were all in a giddy state of mind. Having dined in many places in Europe it felt incredibly familiar and welcoming. With a little jostling among the young wait staff as we began to be seated, the owner soon made an introduction and we earnestly began to line up plate after plate to share of apps and entrees. Sharing a meal with a large group on a budget can be a little frantic but we all enjoyed EVERY dish. Most memorable were the house-made sausages, the fish and goulash. Seriously, everything was absolutely great. In the background was a duo of musicians playing wonderful standards to our delight, which added to the old-world ambiance. The restaurant is clearly the dreamwork of one proud owner with a strong vision for what it should and shouldn't be. It was polished, well-thought-out and just lovely for a group like us or a little romantic evening. We passed a hat around with lots of cash to reward the fine musicians (they were really, really good). After polishing off several bottles of BYOB wine, we said goodnight in hugs to the band and our fine host. Upon leaving the interior, we stopped by the window that overlooks the kitchen in full view.

I read a ton of reviews before going so my expectations were high. Upon entering, I was shocked my the small size. Its super tiny! I (4 year vegetarian) came with my mom (meat eater) and there was like three 2 person tables available and we were seated almost right away. It was full of hipsters with their skinny jeans and tattoos. haha, it was cute. The waiters/waitresses were super hip and sweet. My water was never empty. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip for our appetizer and it was good but not great. It coulda used more spinach but we still ate it all. I got the avocado tostados since i was nervous about the whole fake meat thing. My mom got the chili. My tostados were crazy good! sooo yummmy. I'm still full. My mom loved her chili and ate every bit of it. However, the people sitting next to us, (literally like right next to us. its small.) got the ruben and now i am regretting my meal choice. It looked amazing to say the least. Still, Our meals were delish. I wanted the cookie dough shake but they were out :( pooh. so i got the chocolate peanut butter. it was good and tasted like a resse cup. All together my bill was $34. not too bad. We plan on going there again when i take my placement tests and other school stuff. This place is a must for vegetarians/vegans! even my mom, a proud meat eater, added this place to her top 5. try it out",4,0,0,0,1,o54U2VkQama8FI30qDkWvw

Not wanting to cause a commotion I paid it since I was the host. Is this legal, there must a law against this? Increasing prices on a new menu is one thing, but adding a surcharge to every item is tacky and hopefully illegal. On top of this insult, the food was average, probably because they are now too busy and now more expensive.

The hustle and bustle of the outside world immediately disappears as soon as you step into the dimly-lit hallway that appears to shrink off in the distance (think willy wonka). Two doors slide open and like stepping into the Holodeck on the Enterprise you enter a entirely different environment than the one you just moments ago became accustomed to. I find it difficult calling what happened next a 'meal' as the term simply does not adequately describe an evening at Alinea. It was a perfectly-choreographed event with the story-line being the 18 or so courses laid out in front of us. The attention to detail is astounding, from the smallish separated dining rooms, to the many customized serving vessels, to the chairs that somehow remained comfortable for the duration of the 3 hours we spent there. All the dishes, many a single bite, were so rampant with flavors and textures that I took to pausing a few moments before swallowing to allow the flavors to mix and produce an entirely new element to the dish that I had not experienced just moments before. Taking things slow is a must here. Eat too quickly and you would miss out on the subtle flavors and additions offered by each ingredient. One recurring theme of many of the more substantial courses was that the whole was always greater than the sum of the parts. Flavors that maybe did not amaze on their own combined in a way that elevated all the components involved into one cohesive, unforgettable bite. Some courses were interactive without being annoying. Cutting my own greens off the ""living garden"" centerpiece for the salad course was a strangely satisfying experience. The salad itself was also unreasonably good. My only warning about this place is to have an open mind. This is not the restaurant to go to if you're looking for classical dishes and/or a typical appetizer, entree, dessert progression with large portions. What you will get at Alinea is the food of a gifted culinary artist, presented in ways that will surprise you and challenge your ideas of what food can be.",5,0,0,0,0,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA

Now for the 20 or so small bowls of side dishes that come with the meal.  We had a blast trying to figure out what each thing was.  One person would taste, guess and pass it on.  It was definitely an experiment! We also ordered a small bottle of SoJu.  I was familiar with it from previous Korean restaurants and love the smooth taste but it was a bit strong for me to sip.  While one of my dining companions sipped it straight,  I mixed with a little soda.

The Place was packed and understandable so we made a reservation and explored the area while we were waiting to be called, so we're in the gift shop across the street when the manager comes yelling in at us for not picking up the phone, so they sent us upstairs where we stood outside in the cold while no one came  to open the door for us until a nice customer of the restaurant had to stand up from his seat to open it for us. So the waiter look baffled as we walk in like we didn't belong there, Then after he guides us to our seats, We sit for a long period of time before they brought us our menus lol.

The appetizers were average compared to other restaurants we've eaten at so not much to say there.So during all of this we were humored by their staff which I could have sworn did not know proper English except for our first waiter who we could see did not want to be there. We never got a proper bottle of soy sauce and chili pepper sauce which we actually got up and asked for... in a Chinese restaurant for real? Okay so there other problems whit the service which I could go on rambling about but lets go to the main course.The hotpots came out, we tasted the stock in the pot, it was below average tasted kinda bland. The raw seafood and vegetables came out looked liked a regular setup for a hotpot meal, cooked up the seafood and vegetables and tried it. the seafood tasted old especially the mussels and squid. There was some positives about the meal i got to try some new items like fish meatballs and bamboo which tasted pretty good, but we didn't trust their vegetables. The meats came out, the beef was mostly fat tasted hard and old. The lamb after it was cooked tasted pretty much like beef with a bit more texture nothing special there. Oh yeah almost forgot about the sauces they did give us, my recommendation to you don't try it garlic sauce was terrible smelled like my old science fair project no lie. The barbecue sauce had some hard precipitate in it, tasted expired. They looked like they just came out of the freezer so we ate everything bland no sauce and never got that soy sauce.

Luckily there was no wait for a party of two as it was just 5pm, although the restaurant was already quite packed and definitely poppin'. We sat on one of the inconveniently high communal-style bar tables, which turned out to be a surprisingly good time and quite enjoyable. Being a gastropub-like establishment, they have a pretty intensive list of beverages, with wines from different countries and many European beers on tap. The bf and I went with 1/2 bottle of the Pinot Grigio, which was just perfect for a hot and humid afternoon. As for the food, I love the small-plate concept here, which allows for easy sharing and optimum pleasure of the palate. While the menu is certainly pork-centric (which is absolutely fine by me), they do have several antipasti and vegetable dishes that can round out an otherwise rich meal nicely. - Raw corn, Heirloom Tomatoes & Arugula Pesto: this cold antipasti was the epitome of summer on a plate. You could really taste the freshness of the sweet corn and heirloom baby tomatoes that are at the peak of their season, dressed ever so simply with a light arugula pesto that's just slightly bitter and herbaceous. - Braised Baby Artichokes, Fingerling Potatoes, Asiago & Salami Toscana: calling this a braised artichoke dish may be somewhat misleading, as the baby artichokes are mostly just brined. It is very good however, and unmistakably Italian in flavor, a friendly complement to the pinot grigio we were sipping on. - Pork Neck Bone Gravy with Ricotta from the ""Smears"" section: this was again very Italian in preparation and flavor; what is essentially a Sunday red gravy contained tender chunks of pork neck meat and fresh ricotta was served bubbling in a ramekin and oh-so-comforting. The grilled filone bread served with the smear was great as well, liberally brushed with olive oil with just a little char. - Milk Braised Pork Shoulder with Mashed Potatoes: it's no wonder that this is the signature dish at The Purple Pig. I don't even think words can do this amazing pork dish justice, so I won't try to, besides just say that it was one of the best pork shoulder preparations I've had in a long, long time. This place is a serious party. Swine, dine, wine baby. Swine, dine, wine. -- *Yeah, NYC, get on that! Before the Second City catches up to ya!",5,2,1,1,0,boE4Ahsssqic7o5wQLI04w

At first we were a little overwhelmed by the enormous menu, but then i realized that about half of it was synonyms for ""soup,"" and I felt better. We ended up getting the #43 pho and the #68 rice noodles. They were both basically rice noodles in broth with lots of goodies. my bf mainly ate the pho, as I'm not a huge fan of whatever spice they use in it (star anise, maybe?), but it was still delicious. so rich! My soup was AMAZING. I have a small obsession with fish balls, and refuse to share them. The shrimp were super fresh, tons of noodles, and lots of basil to make it all taste that much better. YUM. Being the dessert hounds that we are, we pulled a ""we want what they're having!"" and pointed to the people at the table next to us. It turned out they were having the #252, which was triple color topped with coconut milk. It was... not for us. I don't mind the sweet bean paste in moderation (in sweet buns-- yum!), but cold and slurped through a straw, it was just too beany. Point is, some parts of it were really delicious, but only if you really like beans. We will def be back, though, because the broth alone is worth it for a return trip.

It is sad that after living in Edgewater for over 20 years, a quality Asian restaurant opened up and fell from grace so soon. First off, I can thank Indie Cafe for the fact that I will never order any type of Sushi with crab meat ever again. Secondly, every time that I've ordered carry-out in the last 6 months they have screwed it up. Rather than correct their consistent screw-ups, Indie Cafe offers me ""$2.00 off of my next order."" As if!!!!!!!!!!!! When it comes to dining in, they screw things up as simple as the order the food should be brought. Since when are appetizers served after the main course?!?

Highly recommend getting a sampler and tasting the differences in flavor and texture between the varieties. On to dinner- she had the sampler, which came with garlic sautéed shrimp (large, butterflied), scallops (small and very tender- not a but of chewiness that comes with being overcooked) and a decent-sized crab cake (which happily was mostly crab and NOT stuffing...can't stand that!). Her meal was accompanied by a bit of rice and sautéed spinach.  A nicely proportioned meal that leaves you satisfied, not overstuffed. I ordered the lobster roll. The roll was accompanied by a large pile of fries- they were ok, not as crispy as I prefer, but it's difficult to ruin a fry.  The sandwich on the other hand, was a star!!  Our server (who was great, very knowledgeable and friendly!) mentioned the bread and mayonnaise are made in-house from scratch and the lobsters are fresh-shucked at the restaurant as well.  I cannot emphasize how delicious this sandwich was- a very generous amount of lobster stuffing in a light, toasted roll- the sweet flavor of the lobster really shone through and while most of it was manageable, there were some pretty big mouthfuls in there (this is a good thing!!) All in all, I would not hesitate to visit Shaw's again or reccomend it.  The food was well worth the cost and I'm actually considering squeezing in another oyster night before our trip is up, mmmm.",5,1,2,0,0,dKcO9OQ44RPRlkWe-vToFA

I also had the opportunity to visit the dining room.  The experience was unforgettable.... as in I'm never going there again.  I invited my family to this restaurant. Waitstaff was rude,it took them about 45 minutes to take my order and the dining room was empty, waitstaff was clueless, and the food arrived cold and tasteless.  It's a shame I had to pay for that kind of service especially when in this economy people are very selective about how and where they spend their money.  People, seriously, don't believe everything you see in ""Check Please"".  Any dumba** can call themselves a foodie. I regret following their advice when they recommended visiting ""Cemitas"" located on North Ave. during the weekend.

We had a reservation at 6:30pm on a Saturday, and the place was buzzing and nearly packed when we arrived, which I feel is a huge indicator of its popularity and the NEED to have a reservation. We were seated on the outdoor patio and began to look over the menu to see which appetizer we wanted to try. We debated between the Choripan (chorizo on bruschetta) or the empanadas. We ended up going with the emapanadas since we were able to pick the stuffing on any three and chorizo was an option. We went with the said chorizo above, beef, and goat cheese. These took about 10 minutes to come out, and they were delicious! Our favorite was the goat cheese which oddly was a light pink color, but nonetheless tasted as you would have anticipated. The beef was pretty good--well spiced but the texture of the meat wasn't my favorite, it was kind of chunky. Lastly, the chorizo was unlike many chorizos we've tried in the past... it almost had a pepperoni like flavor? This made us glad we didn't get the Choripan. As for the entrees, we got the following: 1) Puerco Rostizado (Pig roast infused with guayaba, pan fried with grilled onions, and served with black beans, white rice, and maduros): This was the winner of the evening. The pig roast was stuffed with the guayaba fruit, giving it a slight sweet flavor. The shredded pig roast was incredibly tender and succulent, making each bite incredibly savory. It was topped with grilled onions which also gave it another sweet flavor. I almost ordered the ""Lechon"" dish under the dinner plates, but the waiter said this dish was better, and I 100% believe it! I'd highly recommend this and my boyfriend was jealous that he didn't get my dish. 2) Ropa Vieja (Traditional Cuban dish made with shredded beef, onions & peppers long-cooked in a Creole sauce): The meat was a little stringy, but the onions and peppers really made the dish in my opinion. With each bite of the meat you could taste the flavors of the onion and peppers. I only had a small sampling, but my boyfriend that this dish was just ""ok"". The beans that came with both dishes were extremely tasty, and they gave you a lot of broth with it, so we dumped some of the massive portion of rice we were given into the beans. A great side to each entree. The fried plantains were a little disappointing. They fry these up in large quantities and plate them as the dishes are prepared, so they come out luke warm and a little soggy. The service was pretty solid, our waiter was very friendly and offered up suggestions. Even though their menu says no corkage fee, we learned that there was in fact a corkage fee.

It was great then and I enjoyed Brazzaz just as much. I was familiar with the concept so I lightly grazed the salad bar. I was saving room for the meat and it just kept coming. Wine by the glass was a good selection to go with all this meat. The service was good to excellent. I felt the lay out of the tables were ok and the food to be fresh. I just got a 1/2 price coupon for this place. It will definitely be used over the summer. I have not been to any of the other Chicago style restaurants with this concept. I found Brazzaz to be more than adequate,4,0,0,0,1,1iehp7Z2kejBq3RSeb4Dxg

We went on a Monday in the middle of a rainstorm and were probably the only ones in the dining room, which looked nice but was uncomfortable since their wall length booth was broken and slanted. Overall I was really really dissapointed since I had heard ""best Thai food at Opart"" over and over again. The shu-mai appetizer could have come out of a Costco box, my spicy entree tasted spicy, and that's about it. Just chili, no other spices or flavors, and the beef, green beans and onions could have been presented better. His noodle dish tasted awful in a too sweet gravy that was so oily and unappetizing. The waitress/hostess didn't smile once and was sorting silverware at the counter just feet away from our table and apparently had no awareness or care to stop making such a ruckus. She was also oblivious to other details. For example, I asked for hot water and lemon: 1. She brought the hot water in a water glass, and not a mug. Too hot to hold. 2.

10/27/2010,687pZDyuShgDli0tQUaUzw,wFmQmAQttCRquokCz8Y2pQ,"Probably one of the most overrated pizza joints in Chicago. Over the years, I've heard so many people rave about this place, so when my dinner plans in wicker park didn't work out, I decided to finally cross this place off my list of places to try. Everybody says to try the brews, but not being much of a drinker, I was there for the food.Started off with spinach/tomato dip appetizer. Big mistake. Not only were there almost no tomatoes in it, they served it with what seemed to be non-flavored Doritos... Really?!? I'm not a snob that needs anything fancy, and I have no problem paying extra for quality, but to charge people $7 bucks for something so obviously cheap is just wrong. The dip itself was just ok tasting, and I would have had no complaint if it cost half that price, but that dip would have had to be mind blowing to justify the cost. It definitely wasn't.On to the pizza... Piece offers up your standard fare, plus some of the less mainstream veggies on three types of pizzas (standard, w/o sauce, or w/o cheese). I'm sort of a traditionalist when it comes to what I put on my pies, especially when trying out a new place, so I went with the regular (Red) style with sausage and mushrooms. Piece gets points for getting the portion size right as the medium is rather big. But, the pizza itself is just so-so at best. The crust  has no body, and in the center it's almost soggy, making it a little of a chore to eat w/o making a mess. The sauce was nothing special, even a little salty, and the toppings were not any better than any other hole-in-the-wall pizza. I didn't hate it, but it definitely did not earn all the hype I had been hearing. Meh.., would probably be the most fitting description.Aside from the food, everything else was as expected. There were no problems with the service, and I did like the music playing on the stereo. Although, it was just a tiny bit too loud.So, two people, 1 beer, 1 appetizer and 1 medium pizza w/ 2 premium toppings.... $40 bucks (including tip). Which isn't bad for a dinner out, but when I think of how much awesome pizza I could've eaten at other, much better places for almost half the cost, going back to Piece just doesn't add up.",2,0,0,0,1,Z2nOMPedr7XYhgYhILJjEA

From the time we met Peter, the owner, we knew we were in good hands. He was knowledgable, accomodating, helpful and always available to answer any questions we had. We made our own package that included, champage greeting, hor doeurves, linens, chair sashes, silverware, sweet table, cake, 7 course dinner, late night snack, wine on all tables and open bar. Peter called me the week of the wedding to confirm the cake, menu and guest count. We went and dropped some boxes off for set up. Peter said they can set up whatever we want. I had some linens I bought, and of course all the decor. By the time DOC got to reception Lido did all the set ups including centerpieces in an effort to help my aunt the florist make the ceremony on time. Everything looked beautiful and just the way I wanted it to look. With DOC's supervision my dream set ups came true. Food was amazing. We had lemon butter chicken that everyone LOVED, beef au jus, vesuvio potatos that were to die for and I ate a lot of, russian pierogi, salad, soup, cucumbers with sour cream and dill and green beans almondine. Our guests raved about the hor deourves that consisted of rolled sandwiches, chichen fingers (YUMO) and super fresh bruschetta. There were drinks and champage on all tables. After dinner they set up the ""sweedish table"" consisting of the sweet table and late night snack which included various salads, meats, breads, fruit, veggies and dip. They packed leftover fruit and sweet table for us to take home, which was a great snack Sunday morning before we left for our mini moon. The staff was amazing and the head  waitress went above and beyond to make us happy, fetching whatever we requested. I felt taken care of and my guests raved about food, decor and service.

You can tell the Chef has a sweet tooth throughout his savory fare, and he really employs this passion perfectly in the desserts!

The waitress was friendly and accommodating, though the place is so busy, you shouldn't expect your server to be readily available at all times. Decor is very hip. Ambience is youthful and trendy; I'm not, but Sunda made me seem cooler for just a few moments. Lots of young business types standing and drinking at the bar. I was impressed by the diverse crowd (though trending young), since there were different races, a good mix of men and women, and some gay fellas (yay, it must be cooler here than I thought). We had the oxtail potstickers, which taste a lot better than they look (tender braised meat in a thin wrapper, covered with a tasty sauce); the steamed duck bao (which are more like slider-sized sandwiches with bouncy and slightly sweet twists of bao dough encasing the meat); and loompya. The loompya was good, but since I've had a lot of different kinds of this type of dish, it was the least memorable for me. Shanghai style (like they serve here) is my favorite, though, because it's thinly rolled and crispy and great with a dipping sauce. We also got the truffled takaki (the ""all of the above"" version) sashimi. This consists of thinly sliced pieces of fish wading in a light sauce and covered with various delicate leafy sprigs (watercress and something else I cannot recall). The quality of the sashimi was excellent, with that exquisite transition from firm to buttery texture while you are eating it that blows your mind. The cocktails were fanciful (trendy? imaginative?) but not strong, so I have no excuse for my lack of recall about which girly fruity concoction I picked. I remember that they were flavorful and enjoyable in the way that sunny cocktails whose primary target group are women generally are.

The wine list offers a variety of Greek and non-Greek wines. For appetizers the feta cheese with olives or the taramosalata spread on pita, the dolmades or hot lima beans are good starters. The lamb dishes are very flavorful and so well prepared. The kokkinisto, lamb in tomato sauce is a favorite as are the keftedes. The best way to end one of these meals is with a strong Greek coffee. The service was good..didn't hover yet didn't make you feel lonely. I really like the atmosphere of this restaurant.

Finally on the coldest day of the year so far, we decided to wait outside for hot dogs. The only thing keeping the review of Hot Doug's from reaching 5 stars is the lack of heating lamps outside for the 20 minute wait. We had a Chicago dog, duck fat fries, and the pheasant sausage with truffle and foie gras. The run down: 1.) The Chicago Dog was good, but standard. If it was just the Chicago dog, the wait would have not paid off. 2.) The duck fat fries were delectible and come in huge portions. These are some bad ass MF's. My first instinct was to grab them and run home where no one could steal them from me. 3.) The big ticket item was the Pheasant Sausage with foie gras and truffle. I can not describe the goodness that is encased pheasant with such rich ingredients other than to say, bring a friend and split it. It is way too good to scarf it by yourself.

I have nothing but great things to say about Texas de Brazil, located just a hop skip and jump from State Street in beautiful downtown Chicago.  This elegant restraurant is a meat lover's heaven.  The experienced servers journey their ways throughout a maze of tables with their eyes open for your card. If you flip it to green be ready to be bombared with almost all thirteen of their different meats (try the Picancha!!!) and they will continue to come until you flip it to red. With the gochoes roaming the restraurant with thier sword like skewers it is an amazing experience. This family friendly restraurant is begging for your reservations and when you do I suggest requesting Antonio as your waiter (He was as good as they come.) If your looking for a quick and efficient server he's your man. I went with my girlfriend for my birthday and he pulled our chairs out for us to sit down when either of us got up from the table and filled our glasses up when ever we were running low. He always seemed to be around the table which was very nice.

Grab yourself a Ting! carbonated grapefruit drink to wash it all down and you'll be a happy camper. Sultan's has a nice patio area but I wouldn't mind coming back to sit in one of the intimately lit booths, decorated with Middle Eastern touches. And now just to spice things up, since there are 400+ reviews here, I'll tell you a true story. Back in my younger days I was told I looked like Disney's Aladdin quite often. When I was working a ticket window I had a young theater-minded man sing ""A Whole New World"" to me, quite theatrically. About a week later while utilizing a urinal, a homeless guy a few urinals away seemed to be taking too much of an interest in me.

We ordered for 6 people off the multi- person set menu, so we assumed we would be charged 6 x the single person price.

Never saw the guac and chips after waiting about half an hour, so I asked if the order was coming out soon. �Her response was that she didn't receive an order for that. I told her it was ordered before the meals, and that was followed by not an apology, but backlash/attitude from her. She then brought the guac and chips and left. �She left us with empty drinks, not checking here n there if we were doing okay, etc. A friend asked for his drink twice, and she still hadn't brought it. �Once she finally came back, we asked for his drink, and that was followed by more attitude by her saying Did he REALLY ask for it twice? and walked away to get his drink. While waiting longer for our meals, we noticed the table next to us had a problem with her as well, and lo and behold a manager shows up to talk to them. Once our meals came out we asked for our bill right away because we had other reservations after and didn't think 2 hours would be too short a time for dinner at Carnivale- we were wrong. �Andrea forgot my mac and cheese and the bill, so by that time I was beyond ready to speak to management. �Multiple times my friends and I witnessed her (most likely) talking about us to another waitress, as she looked very annoyed. Eventually a manager came over, we explained everything. She adjusted our bill and we were able to remove the gratuity that was automatically included if we wanted to. You bet I took off her tip. Even AFTER talking to management, Andrea didn't even have the courtesy to apologize for anything. I also never received the complimentary trio cake being that it was my birthday.

A sandwich with a side of steamed kale can set you back $12.00 and the fact that it tastes like every wrong stereotype of meat substitutes and cardboard is wrong - just plain wrong. Maybe my standards for vegan/vegetarian fare was set too high by places that use salt and creative menu choices. Maybe it's the fact that the menu resembles the Morning Star line of products in the freezer a little too closely to justify paying premium for it. Maybe my expectations for seitan to be used beyond the recipe on the side of the package from Whole Foods is expecting too much. (By the way, many of the seitan dishes are NOT healthier just because they're vegan. Whenever was heavily processed wheat healthy? Just another myth being perpetuated.). What is nice about this place though are the soyshakes. Peanut butter chocolate chip cookie dough shakes of any kind can win my heart, but that doesn't mean I'm staying for a burger. The desserts are great, but they're mostly outsourced from various vegan bakeries so that might explain the presence of sugar and spices. Kind of interesting that people give them credit for it.",1,3,4,5,0,o54U2VkQama8FI30qDkWvw

4/8/2011,tE3rfDW1XFMBPS,rtFI0_GrbF6boXFgxXCxPw,"Gilt Bar... How I fell in love with your gastro-pub cuisine. I took my boyfriend here last night for his birthday, as he had tried one of the other gastro pubs in the city and was a major fan. We made a reservation for 6:15 on a Thursday night, and I was happy to see that we did as the place was starting to fill up upon arrival. We had to wait about five minutes to be seated and we were lead to the back of the restaurant near the kitchen. Gilt Bar has an interesting vibe as it is barely lit besides two candles at the table and some scattered unique chandeliers. The kitchen, located at the back of the restaurant, is open so you can see the fantastic food being crafted. An interesting point to note is that they have constructed a seating area that looks into the kitchen, so I'm sure that would be a unique dining experience. Okay, onto the most important part: the food. We started off with two beers (they have an amazing selection of craft brews, both on tap and bottled for about $5-$9 apiece.) We both had taken a look at the menu before coming to the restaurant, so we had a general idea of what we wanted. 1) The Pork Belly: I had never had pork belly before, and this was an amazing entree. The meat literally fell apart when cutting into it, and it was savory... there really aren't words to describe how delicious this was. There were three chunks served on a bed of lentils in an amazing sauce. 2) The Pork Roast: Wowwww... this was even BETTER than the Pork Belly. The meat was moist, tender, and it also fell apart when cutting into it. The sauce that it was served with was outstanding, and I kept on going back for more to dip the pork roast into or to ladle it over the top. This was served with some glazed carrots and I believe some type of small/soft pearl potatoes. All in all outstanding. 3) Side of Cauliflower with caramelized onions: Having recently warmed up to cauliflower, this was a great side dish to pair with the pork. It had an interesting flavor--it was slightly bitter which I feel balanced out the savory meats very nicely. Desserts: Oh. My. God. Since it was my boyfriend's birthday, we splurged on two desserts in celebration. 1) Cookie Dough Ice Cream: I don't know about you guys, but when I normally get cookie dough ice cream I feel like I'm hunting around for the cookie dough pieces, and that I can never seem to get enough. Gilt Bar must have had this predicament in mind when crafting this ice cream. It was literally CHUNKS of cookie dough with ice cream laced around it... I was in cookie dough heaven. At $3 for a single scoop (which was actually two large scoop fulls-- more than enough to share for two people) this ice cream beat out any ice cream I've ever had. I would come back here to get the ice cream alone. Wow. 2) Carrot Cake: As a testament to how delicious this was, my boyfriend is normally not a huge fan of cake and upon the first bite he was speechless. The cake was super moist, they used REAL carrot pieces, and the frosting was perfect--not too sweet and heavy on the cream cheese. I would highly recommend this for a dessert, and you can easily split it between two people. All in all a very solid meal--and to top things off they put a single birthday candle in the cake for my boyfriend's birthday! I would highly recommend this restaurant, it was perfect for a birthday/special occasion dinner.",5,2,2,2,0,sDYjKyI_67eUhFAqVneYjA

It was a lot pricier than what I'm used to but I wanted to splurge. I'd just made a good amount of money from a recent project and wanted something different and on the expensive side. The food itself was rather good. It was presented in a very good manner and the taste was exquisite. The servers were very well trained and knowledgeable when they brought us out our food. They would tell us what the dish was and what was the best way to eat it get the full flavor profile. Make sure you pay attention because the way you eat it actually has a lot of impact on how it tastes. Certain things are meant to be eaten together in the same bite to give it its maximum use of whichever ingredient.

4/29/2010,ryQPHqA6KR55JEYpCkTDWQ,887-WxTKfe6Tcj3o4nNcfQ,"I really can't write anything that hasn't been written before.  Basically, Alinea lives up to the hype.  Simply put, it rocked my world.  It is #7 in Pelligrino's 2010 World's 50 Best Restaurants for good reason. The outside is completely unassuming and the corridor to the restaurant is otherworldly.  We were seated in a room on the second floor and the first thing that caught my attention was that the man next to us was eating a very intricate dessert off the table.  That's right, no plates, just spoon on rubbery tablecloth.  Once seated and settled, it dawned on me how quiet it was.  There was no ambient music.  Even though when we were seated, there were 5 other parties in the room with us (plus a handful of servers), the silence was intimidating.  We felt the need to be quiet and hush-hush as well. We got one wine pairing in a glass that we shared, and that was amazing, for lack of a better word.  The sommelier had a ginormous afro and his demeanor and appearance beared an uncanny resemblance to Johnny Depp's Mad Hatter.  He was energetic and his explanations and background to each and every wine was delightful.  I highly recommend doing the wine pairing; splitting one between two people was the perfect amount to sip on and enjoy with each dish. We weren't disappointed with the 12 course tasting; every course was a crazy mix of a sensory experience that touched upon sight/presentation, smell, taste, texture, sound (yes! Our last dish was a bubble-yum hibiscus cigarette thing that made a funny low pitched grunt as you sucked the contents into your mouth).  This was not just dinner, it was a show.  The whole experience seemed to throw out the conventional concept of eating.  For example, we were given an earl grey infused pillow, not to sleep on, but for our lemon custard earl grey cookie dessert course to sit on, and as the pillow slowly deflated, it emitted the aroma of earl grey as you ate.  How cool is that? At times, we longingly eyeballed the other patrons who were doing the 24 course tour, who were presented with things like a giant log.  Umm, I want to eat whatever delicious morsels off a giant log! At the end of the meal, they present you with a menu in a big black envelope.  That was a nice keepsake and reminder of the most amazing meal I've had to date. There were 2 downsides to my once-in-a-lifetime experience.  First, I got chastised for taking pictures of my dishes.  Seriously?  Okay I understand it's kind of bothersome if you're using a flash but I turned off my flash and I told the woman that.  She said ""but your camera still gives off a light"".  Dude.  It's a red blinking light that most people's camera gives off if you don't use the flash, like the red recording light when you use a video camera.  Hey, we're dropping some big money here, it's not like I'm being a paparazzi and going flash crazy.  The table next to us had to leave early because the woman got drunk after her 5th course, couldn't eat anymore, was throwing her head on the table every 3 minutes and nearly stumbled down the stairs.  And they were frowning on me for taking pics even without a flash?  I'd say her demeanor in the nearly full room was much more distracting than my picture taking when it was nearly empty. Secondly, the staff was attentive, so painstakingly attentive that it was almost borderline uncomfortable.  We could see them lingering at their waiting area talking about other patrons (namely, drunk woman), and sometimes it felt like we were children at a library being observed by the librarian. Still, those two things did not detract from the experience that much, and I cannot speak highly enough of Chef Achatz's culinary creations.  The Alinea experience brings food and eating to a whole new level.",5,7,3,0,0,pbEiXam9YJL3neCYHGwLUA

Every year I must take him to a nice dinner. It gets harder and harder every year. We've been to SEVERAL places as we both are foodies. Okay, so let me get to the point. Interior pictures are hard to find for Sprout. People have mentioned things about it being in an old house and that it wasn't so pretty on the exterior, I don't know what they are talking about... It's beautiful and very modern on the exterior and on the interior! Don't let the menu freak you out, I will admit I was a little scared and didn't know what to expect. They have a pre course for $65.00. You get three items that are DELICIOUS (you get to pick a variety) and they bring out Moooose booose ? ha ha I can't spell that (2 of them) in between dinner. They are AMAZING! Service was super! Truly great! There wasn't a moment that we needed anything and yet the service wasn't intrusive either. Highly recommend! Great for special occasions or just a night out. We will go back and try their brunch! I can see why this place won a James Beard Award and a Michelin award!",5,0,0,0,0,eHtnZ0ISo63_0zr9rFotjw

9/13/2008,ZVf,H32QTRV87Q6CGTVUm1Z4QA,"Icosium Kafe was the perfect stop for dinner and dessert on a rainy Friday evening while shopping on Clark St. My friend and I came in to a mostly-empty restaurant; it's a fun setting, with beaded light fixtures, a checkerboard floor and belly-dance-type music floating around in the background. We parked it and were treated to cucumber-infused water (nice change from the wedge of lemon, and very refreshing), then perused the tempting menu. Since a lot of the predetermined crepes contain tomatoes, which I don't like, I was pleased that there was a ""Build Your Own Crepe"" option; I loaded mine with mixed organic greens, roasted peppers, caramelized onions, roasted garlic, chicken breast ($2.99 extra, but worth it), toasted almonds (these only seemed to be sprinkled sparingly on top), and goat cheese. WOW! I'm not particularly given to hyperbole but this is one of the best things I've eaten in a long time. The crepe itself was of a light texture (I ate at La Creperie, also on Clark, once and the savory crepes were thick and stodgy; yuck), yet held up to all the fillings. The fillings were delicious and the flavors married well together; the goat cheese and caramelized onions were especially well matched. Savory crepes also came with a bowl of soup, on this day pureed vegetable, which was good and had a true, fresh, homemade taste, but since I was eating an entree and knew I wanted dessert too I only ate a bit to save room. For dessert my companion and I split the Crepe Salem with fresh pineapple, honey and walnuts, with whipped cream; we also got a scoop of the pistachio-rosewater ice cream on the side. (I had originally gravitated toward one of the Nutella crepes, but then this caught my eye, and you see crepes with Nutella more often; this seemed more unusual, so I went for it.) Delicious, and the ice cream was very unusual and matched well with the pineapple (wouldn't have done so with the Nutella, I don't think). Again, the crepe itself was light and perfect. Yum. Service was okay; the waitress was young and a bit brisk, and our dessert came out before the entree course was finished. The one downer about the meal had nothing to do with the restaurant per se; it was the people behind us for the first half of the meal. One girl (at a table of three) apparently loved the sound of her own voice and was blowing her mouth off nonstop for half an hour, dropping f-bombs every other word, until they finally, thankfully, left before our dessert came. I can understand blowing off steam for a few minutes on a Friday after work and then moving on to other topics, but this was the only person I heard talking at the table, and since it's a small restaurant, there was no way that anyone could NOT hear her. Rude, really. Again, that has nothing to do with the restaurant itself, though be aware that if you eat here you might end up sitting next to her as you tuck into your crepe! The fear of that isn't enough to keep me away; I'll assuredly be back to Icosium Kafe.",4,0,0,0,0,Rlg07N7Sl1qTzjc7zc6Whg

Also, the chix liver pate and the ricotta and honey comb which were both great and then the pork belly and potato pizza which was not very awesome.  They have a great wood burning oven that they cook their pizza in but this one was just soggy and not crispy and to me,  pork belly is a bigger less crispy version of a bacon lardon but this was more like rib meat.   Our server was a larger gentleman who was very accommodating but could have sold us on the specials by slowing his spiel down. Also, had he taken the time to get to know us he would have realized that my boyfriend is the executive chef at a james beard award winning restaurant in the loop in which the owners of this restaurant enjoy very much.  Myself as a restaurant manager can not stress the importance of getting to know your guests because you really do never know just who you are waiting on.  It was also our three year anniversary which would have been the answer to the simple question, "" Are you celebrating any special occasions tonight?""

I paid $9 for a combination platter, a dish which came with a Taco, Tostada, and 2 Enchiladas.  The portions were huge and the Tostada had so much meat I could not see the shell.  These are not lunch portions folks (even though we were there for lunch), you could probably feed two (moderately hungry) people with one $9 platter, can't beat that.  All the items were pretty tasty also.  I wasn't crazy about the salsa that can with the chips though, it was bland and almost tasted store bought.            The atmosphere is cozy and has a somewhat industrial feel.

Refrigerate the salad in advance?  I guess that works as long as one of the star ingredients of the dish isn't an ingredient that loses all of its flavor once refrigerated.  Oh wait... it is.  Made all the worse by the fact that the tomatoes in the panzanella looked like they were probably great before they were refrigerated.Carpaccio - horrible.  The worst I've had.  I had to send it back.  The first clue should have been the white mayonnaise-like sauce garnishing the dish.  a: there was too much of it.  b: it was not a good sauce.  c: why not put just EVOO since you have a whole paragraph on the menu describing how good your olive oil is?  d: over peppered.  A raw thinly-sliced tenderloin of beef should have a mild flavor.  You don't want to over-pepper that and then cover it with a creamy-mayonnaisy sauce.  Unless perhaps it is because the meat is not good.  Which it wasn't.  Perhaps they were going for a throwback to the old days of French cooking where creamy sauces were used to cover rotten meat.  Yuck.  Nobody likes a gamy carpaccio.Peach Salad (replaced the carpaccio).  If you are going to offer a peach salad in peach season, have good peaches.  Most of my bites were either under-ripe or pasty-fleshy (not enough juice).  The goat cheese crumbled within the salad was delicious.  Another dish that should have been good based on the ingredients, but wasn't.MAINS:Fish Stew (Sapore di mare) - At this point I was expecting overcooked seafood with shrimps that had not had their GI tract removed.  I am happy to say that all of my seafood was both prepared and cooked perfectly.  The broth/sauce, however, was lacking in flavor.  It should scream with delicious sea flavors.  White wine, garlic, tomatoes... how could you NOT make this good?  I should be disappointed with not having another piece of bread to dip in a savory delicious sauce.  Rather it was the sauce/broth that was disappointing.Branzino - cooked whole, then fileted by the staff.  Awkward flavours... tangerine or orange?  Why not just classic olive oil and lemon juice?  Fish was almost cooked perfectly though (just a touch overdone), was very fresh and delicious but for the detracting tangerine flavors.DESSERTS:Would you have stayed for dessert after this beginning?  Neither did we.  I was too busy wishing I had eaten at Il Mulino or Cafe Spiaggia.  Perhaps I should have stopped by Cafe Spiaggia for another taste of the best Beignets I have ever had...",2,0,0,0,1,JMa9cTNQA5mm4GbR2W8Oiw

Apparently they recently remodeled this place... it's bright and orange inside, very bustling at dinner time. It helps I went with a Korean that spoke the language...   I can see how this place might be intimidating to the newly inducted.  But based off of what my Korean friend said, it feels like there's supposed to be some very strict structure, but t's very unstructured dining so you shouldn't have to fear doing something wrong.  You'll probably end up doing odd things though, and surely things that you find odd.... (soup near the end of a meal, for instance.  odd to you maybe, not to them) I would not go here if you're a vegetarian.  It's a very carnivore-oriented meal.  We had the ribeye and spare ribs.  Personally I think the spare ribs were great.  The ribeye was cut a little too thick and was harder to eat/grill right.  The sides were typical, pretty decent though.  And plentiful.  Between the 3 of us we ordered 3 meats, I was leaning towards 2 to start with but they wanted more...  I'm pretty sure we overate! We had a cold noodle soup that was also very tasty.  Don't remember what it was called, but I'd get it again possibly. You have to order at least 2 of the meat items to get charcoal at your table... I can't imagine not doing so, that's the entire fun of going here!   The night we went, there were a few tables of 4 eating at a non-charcoal table though, so if you know when you're going I'd recommend calling ahead.  Also they have kneeling tables where you take your shoes off, these I'd call for too if that's what you want!

Now, my review can only speak for brunch, but, if the mornin' meal they're serving up is this good? Come on, how can dinner be anything less than amazing?? I was really surprised that we easily got an 11:00 reservation, thinking our only options would be 9:00 am or 3:00 pm. First of all, can we please talk about the bloody mary's here?? I only get a craving for a bloody mary every so often, but, after having had it once, I couldn't wait to get back for more. The tomato juice is so unbelievably fresh and the drink is seasoned with perfect amount of saltiness and spice..divine. And I really like that it's not served in a huge pint glass, because it's usually way too filling, and I wind up not wanting to eat anything. Theirs is the perfect size, doesn't fill you up, and compliments the food. The mimosa ain't nothin to sneeze at, either. As if the complimentary beignets weren't enough, our mouths were drooling over the brunch menu. Luckily we were hungry and figured since breaffast is supposed to be the biggest meal of the day, we would go all out. We split the andouille that's served with homemade bread, garlic aioli, and chow-chow, and it is good-good. The sausage is very fresh, not greasy, very flavorful. For my meal I had the Eggs New Orleans and a side of grits (more on that in a moment), and my hubs had the Bayou Teche omelet. I will say that both dishes were hands down the BEST brunch food we've had in a very long time. That's a bold statement to make, people, and I stand by it: THE BEST BRUNCH FOOD INGESTED IN WHO KNOWS HOW LONG! The Eggs New Orleans is crab cakes w/poached eggs, atop a popover and sauced with bearnaise. I drooled typing that. A modified eggs benedict that is surprisingly light and the crab cake gives it a great flavor. The potatoes that come with it are my favorite kind for breakfast: thin, crisp, seasoned with onion and peppers..perfect. I had a few, okay many bites, of the hubs omelet, and, I loved the savory combination of the craw fish and andouille with the sauce. Again, not super heavy, which was surprising given the ingredients. And now for the grits..they get 2 thumbs up. Creamy, buttery, cheesy, savory. Yum. I love grits and Big Jones didn't disappoint.

I'm from Kentucky, for goodness sake. Bluegrass babies are given drum sticks before we're given mother's milk. I have been to the Colonel's original place, his wife's place and one of his descendants is one of my good friends. I know from fried chicken and don't impress easily. I was in the mood for chicken and needed something fast and easy. I was nearby Crisp and thought I'd check it out. I thought I might like it. I wasn't prepared to sing Color Me Badd to it while I turned down the lights. It's everything people described: succulent, sweet, slightly hot, meaty, plentifully portioned. A half order left my belly distended and dead sexy, my mouth covered in sauce and my virtue stripped. I can't imagine what a whole order would do to me.

As others have mentioned, it's a wine boutique so you buy off the shelf and they charge you a 7 dollar corkage fee.  You can get great bottles of wine for great prices..like at cost, not restaurant wine prices.  If you want to get some of the higher end stuff, they even have a secret wine list (shh...you didn't hear it from me).  I think the key is going with people who are willing to share anything and everything.  Four seemed to be the perfect number.  They don't take resos and the wait can be long so make sure to go with people you want to spend time with.

Note: If you have trouble with getting a reservation on OpenTable, just give them a call - even though OpenTable had everything completely booked, one phone call got us a reservation very easily. I really love the idea of the no-menu meal. It's kind of exciting to sit down and just have people deliver you some food. We got to sit right next to the kitchen (which some people might not like, because it's also right where all the food comes out), but I loved it, because I had a perfect view through the service window to see what was going on with the chefs back there. Very cool. We brought a bottle of rose, and they very kindly blast-chilled it for us. Also note: they don't serve anything but water and coffee here, so definitely bring yourself some wine. So usually this is the part where I deliver a blow-by-blow of everything I ate, but since the Sunday menu changes every week by what's available, and we ate here a few months ago, there's not really a whole lot of sense in that, so I will just highlight my favorites of our 8-course meal. There was a scallop, served in the shell, with the most amazing cream sauce. Divine. I must have been making some kind of raptured face or something, because when the waiter came by to ask how everything was, he kinda laughed at me. There was a foie gras donut somewhere in the progression, and the last course was a cheese course - tempura fried cheese curds with a rhubarb sauce - that somehow managed to taste like mozzarella sticks in an elevated playful kind of way. There was only one questionable dish in the middle, a trout mousse with maple syrup. It wasn't bad, per se, but it was just kinda weird. The service was excellent as well. It's not a stuffy restaurant - the waiters/workers seat you and serve you your food and I think also are the managers of the restaurant. They're very casually dressed and personable, the guy who was serving us cracked jokes as he delivered the food. There's an air of ""yes this is damn good food, but we're not gonna be pretentious about it"" that I really liked. At the end of the meal (we were one of the last tables there) we chatted a little with the chef and the servers before leaving. It all felt very neighboorhood-y restaurant, which is rare in ""fine-dining"" restaurants.

The house salad was a disappointment.  I was expecting something a bit more authentic than lettuce, tomato and french dressing on a plate.  It was ok, but certainly nothing I would order on my own and didn't seem to be in any way authenic to the restaurant.  My soup was good (lentil), but I heard that the chicken soup had little flavor.  The entrees were good, garlic naan was delicious and the lamb was especially tasty and seasoned nicely (lobster on the grill plate - overseasoned and overcooked).  The mystery 'special' dessert never appeared.   Service was lackluster.  The server seemed to be mocking our table every time he came by - and hardly ever returned (he finally did and I had to ask for more wine - he didn't offer).  He did, however, notice a flat beer and replace it, so that does take his service score up a notch.   Using the Groupon from a cell phone....this didn't work that well.  They seemed to not know how to do it and also didn't seem to want to attempt to figure it out (I finally realized what they were looking for in order to use it).  I find it hard to believe that the servers have never seen the mobile app for Groupon as I've never had such difficulty using it before at other (smaller) restaurants.   The atmosphere was more that of a tourist spot - kind of half thrown together.  The bathrooms were ok - clean enough, but if you are going to re-do the sink/faucets, please put the faucets close enough to the sink so that your customers don't have to try to acrobatically use the sink without jamming their hands into the sink iteself (no clearance whatsoever to wash hands!).   The beverages are reasonably priced, but the food is a bit on the higher priced side.  The portion sizes are large enough to share an entree with two people.  However, I'm not sure this spot is worth another visit.",2,3,0,0,0,dLS8GPg-K1O-zJ3VJAtiyg

Cramped, but that added to the atmosphere. BYOB is always awesome. Now that they moved it seems like they've changed a lot, now it's more of an upscale, big roomy restaurant. It's nice to not have to wait so long for a table, but I feel like the integrity of the food isn't the same as it was before. I was just here this past weekend and overall had a good experience. They changed their BYOB to exclude weekends which kinda sucks, but they have a pretty good sangria. I got the carne asada which was really good, along with the chimichurri that comes with it, very tasty. I knew I didn't care to much for yuca, (basically a dry hard tasteless potato) so I substituted it for rice and received plain white rice. I didn't touch it.

Thankfully Sunda avoids the usual pitfalls and does a lot of pan-Asian dishes well. Lucky for me, I got to try this place on the company dime, and they way overordered so I didn't feel bad stealing bites of a lot of little things. The sushi is decent. I wouldn't make this a destination when I'm craving it, but they were creative and made for a good conversation starter. I would pass on the veggie roll - it's like crudo wrapped around rice. Too healthy for my needs. Throw in some avocado or cream cheese and we'll talk. The shiitake mushroom roll was tasty, as was the spicy tuna. Also tried the seaweed and mushroom salads. The seaweed salad was actually awesome. It looked like a big bowl of stringy slim but tasted light and refreshing. The mushroom salad was a bit boring, and could have used a more flavorful dressing. Oddly enough, I ended up not liking the shrimp and wasabi appetizer, which is apparently what Sunda is known for. All I could taste was guacamole on top of fried nothing. On the other hand, the corn fritters were fried but pouring with flavor. I wanted to dump the sweet dipping sauce on everything. There were lots of meat dish that looked great. The one vegetarian dish appeared to be a kind of wet crouton salad, but that was just a cover for the garlic noodles laying beneith. They were really, really good, but I had dragon breath for the rest of the afternoon (even after two rounds of listerine). Not a good dish for date night. Last but not least was...mochi! A/k/a Japanses ice cream balls. I'd never tried them before, and was positive they couldn't be as good as ""real"" ice cream, but they were awesome.

I was a bit apprehensive after reading the reviews - though our first visit was just fine. I'm not much of a maki guy, but I figured our friends were pro-maki and didn't need piles of toro. I called about an hour or so prior to getting there and secured a reservation. We were also promptly seated as soon as we showed up. Our table was in the hinterlands all the way in the back past the bathrooms, but service turned out to be flawless. Our waitress was attentive, got all the orders correct, and the pacing was great. Actually, after each round we ordered the next round of dishes. We started with a hamachi jalapeno special - tasty! We also tried the edamae, the warm shrimp salad (sweet corn tempura was interesting in a good way), agadashi tofu, and ceviche. I'd pass on the ceviche as a family style sharing dish. We tried about 9 maki, including three vegetarian ones at the end. The sweet potato tempura, oshinko, and shitake ones were all delicious. We tried the standard rolls - white dragon, ceviche, spicy scallop, a special with smoked salmon and cream cheese, super white tuna, etc. Nothing was all that memorable and it was at times like eating candy, but it was a fun dinner and everyone left happy.

Maybe this place used to be the cat's meow, but it was a far cry from it on this occasion.  The drinks were decent, but nothing you can't get at another upscale bar in the neighborhood.  If you go, I would encourage getting the dishes (versus the courses menu), but even that was wildly overpriced for what you get.   I must say I walked in and thought ""wow, I can't believe it's more busy on a Saturday night at 8pm"", and I left saying, ""no wonder this place isn't busy"".  If you end up footing the bill, consider yourself warned.",2,1,0,0,0,LlHEzxQTiiLJokn2tli35A

I only knew about this place from walking by it on Michigan Avenue. To be fair I hadn't heard anything about it at all. I just assumed that it must be good based on the size of the crowd I often see waiting outside. My first problem, as is the first problem with all disappointing restaurants, - the service was awful. Normally I give hostesses and waitresses the benefit of the doubt because I was there once and I am fully aware that sometimes it is simply impossible to serve all your tables well, especially when the place is packed and you are short on staff. The problem here was we went on Tuesday, late in the morning, and we were the ONLY customers there. The waitress came out, asked if we knew what we wanted, we said no, and then we were given a generous menu browsing time of about 20 minutes. The time between ordering and receiving food was equally extreme. My second problem was that the food was OK, it wasn't terrible, but when one goes to a breakfast restaurant and pays ridiculous prices for some fairly simple to make breakfast foods, one expects to be given a fairly good meal. This food was more on par with Denny's on the late late shift. Unfortunately, this time I simply wasn't drunk enough to enjoy it.

This place is gorgeous...awesome interior design, beautiful lighting, and a great menu. Many of the tables are communal, like in a beer hall which can be either really fun or really annoying if you're seated next to idiots who think it's okay to slam their fists on the table every 30 seconds while yapping way too loudly about their awesomeness. Anyhow, it's quite lovely inside. I had never really been to a gastropub before this, so wasn't totally sure what to expect. It's slightly daunting in that sense, but it's also exciting for those who like to try new things. We decided on the mussels and fries which were suuuper good. I'm not sure what all these complaints are about the fries not being exquisite creations from heaven....they're french fries...either they suck or they don't. These ones happen to not suck. They are actually quite good. The mussels, our waiter explained, are made with a lambic base rather than a white wine base, which is what mussels are always cooked with. I had never had mussels before, and our waiter lamented that it's generally downhill from the Publican's. I believe him. They were delicious. The beer list was great, and we were able to pick fun new things to try. The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that the bussers were a little over-eager.

My husband surprised me with dinner at Alinea for my birthday, and it epitomized a luxurious dining experience in every way. Alinea knows what its doing, from top to tippy toes. Instead of deconstructing every aspect of my superb meal, I present the highlights: - attention to detail, from a new linen napkin every time you get up to visit the restroom, to the valet who found us free parking across the street - a vegetarian meal that substituted ingredients to create food that never compromised on flavor, AND produced results identical to what everyone else was eating - personalized souvenier menus - courses that focused on all the senses - especially sight, taste, and smell (the sweet smell of cedar, the nutmeg air - infused pillow) Every part of our food was surprising and beautiful, but I do think Alinea does better on savory courses than sweet. Only because these are the memories that linger. Special standouts were the one bite courses. I could never imagine that such a burst of complementary flavors could come through in a single mouthful.

I also used to love that they were BYOB, now they have a corkage fee and we were charged $5 PER PERSON to open a bottle of wine on our last vist.  The fee to open the wine was more than we paid for the bottle.  Also, our food came out a such a rapid pace we only had time to enjoy one glass of wine with our meal before the check came.  The whole experience felt rushed and unenjoyable.  Part of the reason I loved going there so much was for the ambiance and the ability to enjoy a meal at your own pace.  It feels as if they have so many people wanting to dine there and they don't quite know how to handle the volume.  I think it will be awhile before I return to Indie, I'm going to have to look for a new Sushi place on the Northside.",2,1,1,3,0,qkfBgSCbekH3DHTanVL1_w

So we waited and waited and waited and waited.  When I got to the front I was pretty sure I would hate this place.  There was a long line up but the place wasn't even packed.  I saw the foie gras and duck dog and HAD to order that and asked Doug's recommendation on a good dog to go with.  He recommended the beef, pork and garlic one and funny enough that was exactly what I was thinking.  I asked how it should be dressed and he told me he liked it with everything but relish.  I agreed again and told him we had the same taste in food.  He said he wasn't sure because he enjoyed eating babies and I told him I also enjoyed eating babies but before 6pm which we both laughed.  I also got an order of the duck fat fries!!! This was the absolute richest meal I had in Chicago, a city full of rich meals and my was it a great meal.  I'm pretty sure I love these hot dogs over any of the ones I tried in Chicago.  The foie one is VERY rich and near the end can get difficult to eat because of the duck, foie and the cream sauce on it.  The regular dog I had was amazing and probably my favourite hot dog I've ever which includes most of the popular brands in Chicago as I didn't try them all...only because I didn't know them all.  It had a great smokey taste and was cooked perfectly being really juicy inside.  I'll be back for more.  The duck fat fries and my cherry coke were also delicious.  I'm pretty sure I'd wait 20+ minutes again for hot dogs but they better be from Hot Doug's.

The Violet Hour models itself after a turn-of-the-century speakeasy with its signless exterior and handcrafted Prohibition-era cocktails.  From the outside, the bar is unidentifiable with its unmarked wooden sliding door, save for the line that quickly forms by 10 pm.  Patrons are allowed entry only if open seats are available to encourage conversation, and cell phone use is prohibited.  The result?  A bar filled with just the right amount of in-the-know clientele who appreciate the extra effort.   Most of the seating consists of gorgeous dark blue high-backed chairs with candlelit glass tables.  Light blue walls with white accents and dark wood give the room a gorgeous sheen of color that pops beautifully through the candlelight.  Booths and seats at the bar are also available, but neither feels quite as elegant as the chairs.   Precision and attention to detail go into these drinks like I've never seen.  One round of drinks can take up to 15 minutes for your server to bring back to the table, but the wait is well worth it.  Violet Hour handcrafts its own bitters, syrups and even various ice cube shapes to best complement each type of drink.  It's impossible to go wrong with a cocktail here.  Two standbys I always try include their seasonal sangria (so far the summer sangria has been my favorite) and any of their drinks with egg whites.  The egg whites sound a bit strange, but they add a frothy, delicious texture to the cocktails that makes them truly unique.  The cocktail menu is divided by liquor type and includes extensive options based with rum, whiskey, brandy, tequila or other spirits.   Service has always been excellent here.  Everyone demonstrates a knowledgeable, friendly attitude, and I'm impressed with how familiar servers are with the nuances of each cocktail.   Some are turned off by the waits at the door that can last up to an hour or longer, but going earlier in the evening (around 9 pm) or with a small group can mitigate much of this.  Also, this is one of the ONLY bars I'll still wait in line for.  Considering that I stopped doing this at most bars several years ago, that's a pretty bold statement for me to make!  Many times, I've reassured curious first-timers next to me in line that the wait is worth it. And worth it the Violet Hour is.  If you're looking for a classy spot with drinks that taste as good as the decor looks, this place is a must-try.  You'll walk away feeling like you've just discovered one of Chicago's best-kept secrets.",5,3,1,1,0,oEFJ29zAQaCNnQzebHQvpg
2/25/2011,4lksAZsA1xTmvfsNuGliMg,4QQD4gb6pKOPcWHF85i5Mw,"Frontera Grill, one of Rick Bayless' Chicago restaurants, aims to please savvy, sustainability-minded customers.  We found their selection of humane animal products to be impressive.  The menu changes every several weeks, but the restaurant's commitment to sourcing welfare-friendly ingredients seems to be a constant.  Information about specific ingredients can be found on the restaurant's website and also on its menu de jour.   Frontera Grill uses chicken and duck that comes from Gunthorp Farms.  The free-range birds spend a lot of their lives outside as they are pastured at three weeks of age.  The Pollo en More Amarillo entree we ordered was quite tender and delicious.   Cage-free eggs come from Little Farm on the Prairie where the hens live outside as weather permits. The restaurant sources it lamb from Crawford Farm, where the animals roam on pastures and eat seasonal forages.  Cheese and dairy products come from Prairie Fruits Farm and Otter Creek Organic Farm.  Prairie Fruits is a completely grass-fed operation while Otter Creek emphasizes rotational grazing and pasture-based living for their organic cows when the weather is hospitable. Beef is from Creekstone Farms or Tallgrass Beef.  Tallgrass Beef is completely grass-fed and grass-finished, meaning that the cows are never fed grain.  Pastured goat is purchased from Pleasant Meadows Farm.  Frontera Grill buys pork from Maple Creek Farm in Wisconsin.  There the pigs are fed sustainably farmed soy and corn. They are semi-confined but allowed to roam regularly. Room for improvement:  Consider sourcing beef products that are completely grass-fed and grass-finished to protect cattle health.  We would also like more information about the production practices on specific farms, namely how the pork is produced.   The Humane Choice is a project of Food Animal Concerns Trust (FACT). This restaurant was reviewed by FACT staff members Larissa McKenna and Lisa Isenhart.  FACT is a Chicago-based non-profit organization dedicated to improving the way animals are raised on farms.  For more information on our work and mission, please visit http://www.foodanimalcon….",5,4,1,0,0,AqgG-1aD6JYj9D6OmBWO3w
